# Question:
While volunteering to help with computers at your church, you are given access to giving records. Because of your work, you unexpectedly discover your senior pastor does not give anything to your church. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

# Dilemma Breakdown:
The dilemma in this situation is that the pastor is the leader and model of a church, and most forms of Christianity recommend a weekly tithe to fund the church and its services to the community. Seeing that the church leader is not following the practices that they (most likely) preaches about is incredibly hypocritical, but confronting the pastor about this could lead to further social issues down the line. Therefore, I believe three reasonable responses could be taken:

# Response 1: Do nothing right now. There could be other plausible reasons.
### Reasoning:
The record not showing the pastor giving does not instantly insinuate that the pastor is not monetarily giving to the church. If the pastor has shown other reasons to cause the previously established assumption, then maybe choose another option, but in most situations, this evidence does not require immediate action. Besides, the pastor's giving is between him and God.

| No extra work required            | Does not resolve any issuesÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â       |
| Puts trust in your leadership.    | Decision was based on an assumption rather than the facts in front of you |
| Does not get anyone else involved | Permanently alters your perception of the pastor.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â       |
### Expected Dialogue:
- Me: "Oh, this document shows the giving records... yet I don't see the senior pastor here. Hmm... well, it's not my business; that's between him and God, and there's probably some other reason it's not on here."
### Verse: Proverbs 25:8
"Do not hastily bring into court, for what will you do in the end when your neighbor puts you to shame?"
### First Principle: Trust in the pastor
- The pastor most certainly has his why his giving does not show up on the document, so trusting that he is right standing with the Lord is the perfectly passive option.

# Response 2: Ask the pastor about it directly
### Reasoning:
This record strongly indicates that the senior is not a "cheerful giver" as required in 2 Corinthians 9:7 or the giving practice Paul asks for in 1 Corinthians 16:2, which are the main reasons for tithing after fulfilling the Old Testament law. Therefore, the Bible recommends confronting the person directly before bringing in anyone else to prevent gossip or miscommunication.

| Hear directly from the source about what is going on | Appear accusatory to the pastorÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  |
| Following biblical principles                        | Pastor loses trust in you because of your snooping  |
| Brings to light sin that thrives on secrecy          | Lose your job because of unwarranted investigation. |

### Expected Dialogue:
- Me: "Hey, Pastor, I was going over some financial documents, and I noticed that you weren't on the list of things. Is there a reason for that?"
- Pastor: "Well, why are you looking through those documents? Second, yes, there is a reason for that. I can sit you down and explain it later if you want, but I'm busy right now."
- Me: "Okay, just wanted to make sure nothing was going on."
### Verse: Matthew 18:15
"If your brother sins against you, tell him his fault, between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother."
### First Principle: Direct confrontation
- The Bible commands us to confront someone directly about their sin before spreading the word to others, so the first step should be talking to the pastor directly.

# Response 3: Reach out to the financial workers to see if this is common knowledge
### Reasoning:
Considering that this church has a "senior pastor" and thus other pastors, there is also likely some financial group or worker who would know more about this predicament. Therefore, asking the economic section of the church for more information before confronting the pastor directly will either immediately clear your suspicions or give you all the information you need before talking to them.

| âœ… Pros                                                                         | ðŸš« ConsÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  |

| Works indirectly to gather information to either avoid or assist confrontation | Appears to be going behind the back of the pastor |
| Avoids confrontation until you are more prepared                               | Not a biblical principleÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  |
### Expected Dialogue:
- Me: "Hey, I was reviewing some financial documents and noticed that the pastor did not appear to be tithing. Is there a reason for that?"
- Financial worker: "Oh, that's quite an observation. There is a reason for that; sit down, and I can address your concerns."
- Me: "Thank you, I appreciate it."
### Verse: Proverbs 18:13
"To answer before listening - that is folly and shame."
### First Principle: Gathering information
- Before confrontation, you should look for information elsewhere to see if this is the case or if it is common knowledge.

# My Choice:
Of all the options presented thus far, I choose option 1. There are a myriad of simple reasons why the senior pastor does not appear to be giving the the church, such as:
- They make the financials quick and straightforward by giving themselves a flat 10% pay cut from a previously declared salary.
- They give anonymously, so their name is not on the record.
- They believe that the practice of tithing with money has been fulfilled, but they contribute to the community and are less fortunate in other ways.
- The document mentions monthly givers, and the Pastor decides to give yearly.
Confronting the pastor directly would most likely cause more issues, and getting information from other sources is just going behind the pastor's back. If more things occur to provoke further investigation, then peruse further. However, because this is the first time you discovered the pastor doing something like this, there is no reason to act yet, but you should be evaluating the pastor from here on out in case you need to use this information later.
