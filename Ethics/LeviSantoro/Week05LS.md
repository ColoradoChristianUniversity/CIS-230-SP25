# Question:
You are a Computer Science professor at a local university teaching C Sharp to some very smart business students. In the second week of class, you spend an entire lecture with your students exhaustively talking about software plagiarism and copyright law with a Christian intellectual property attorney who makes it truly clear that taking code from another developer or site then calling it your own is not only legally wrong but morally wrong. In addition, your institution publishes the following policy:

> Plagiarism includes using someone else's data file as your own or representing the work of others as your own.

> The penalty for violating the academic integrity code is severe. Any student violating the academic integrity code may receive a failing grade for the course and will be reported. If a student is unclear about whether a particular situation may constitute an academic integrity violation, the student should meet with the instructor to discuss the situation.

> For this class, it is permissible to assist classmates in general discussions and such general advice and interaction is encouraged. Each person, however, must develop his or her own solutions to the assigned projects, assignments, and tasks. In other words, students may not "work together" on graded assignments unless specifically assigned to a group task by the course instructor. Such unauthorized collaboration would constitute cheating. A student may not use or copy (by any means) another's work (or portions of it) and represent it as his or her own.

**Then this**

Just a week or two into class, one of your students submits an assignment that is very good. Too good? You check and discover the code is identical to a C# tutorial on the internet. It is clear the student copied the code. The writing is on the wall. But remember, you love this student: you don't want to overreact. But you love your other students too: you want to be fair. You are also a new professor at this university: you don't want to underreact. A lot to think about. What do you do? 

# Dilemma Breakdown:
The first part of this dilemma is deducing whether the actions taken by the student are classified as plagiarism, followed quickly by an appropriate punishment. However, the punishment should not be too harsh since you like this student and still want them to like you, and it should not be too lenient since you are new to this institution and should follow the rules.
As I see it, the situation changes depending on specifics. Therefore, some assumptions will be made:
* This is a minor assignment since it is the beginning of the year.
	* This changes the score I would give to the student. If it were more critical, I would give the student more grace in their final score so it still impacted them, but they could recover. 
- The assignment has almost zero differentiation from the code; they pressed Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V.
- This is a first-time violation for the student, so there is little mention of drastic honor code actions.
- I would change the assignment to be more unique in the future.
- I would briefly re-address the school policy & what to do in future situations at the start of the next class. 
- I asked the student if they wrote the code, and they said "yes."

# Response 1: Give the student a zero on the assignment and a warning.
### Reasoning:
The student copied someone else's solution line for line, which was explicitly addressed: "Each person, however, must develop his or her own solutions to the assigned projects, assignments, and task." This is not general advice; the student did not develop their own solution, so they should not receive any credit for the assignment. However, this is the student's first time doing such a thing, so a more extreme punishment is not required.
### Pros:
- Student receives a punishment proportional to the work they did not do.
- Not overreacting with the punishment and no embarrassment to anyone but themselves.
- Because the assignment is minor, it gives them a chance to recover in the class, especially if they did not realize this fell under the plagiarism category.
### Cons:
- Student violated academic policy yet only received a zero on a minor assignment, which may not be enough of a deterrent.
- You are not sure if this action is overreacting or underreacting.
### Expected Dialogue:
*This would be on the assignment feedback section for the student*
- Assignment Feedback: "I have given a zero on this assignment due to this code being directly copied from this tutorial. As a reminder, our school policy of plagiarism includes "using someone else's data file as your own or representing the work of others as your own." Since this is your first violation, I will not take further steps. Next time, develop your solution or indicate that the solution was not your own If you have further questions, please email me directly.
### Verse: Colossians 3:25
For the wrongdoer will be paid back for the wrong he has done, and there is no partiality.
### First Principle: Proportional Punishment
- The student performed plagiarism on an assignment and thus should receive no credit for it.

# Response 2: See if the student understands everything they wrote and give them a warning.
### Reasoning:
The saying goes: "There is nothing new under the sun." While there are many unique solutions to a problem in coding, it is not wrong to search for an optimized solution that perfectly fits your unusual requirements. Therefore, while the student copied the code from the tutorial, **it is a tutorial**, a device used for learning. Therefore, if the student adequately learned from the tutorial and understands every line of code they "wrote," there is no reason to punish them for finding a solution to a problem someone else has already solved. This is definitely a case bordering on plagiarism, so a warning should still be given directly to them and the rest of the class for the future, but no punishment is required.
Of course, if the student did not learn anything from the assignment, a grade of 0 is the appropriate response.
### Pros:
- Validates the student's effort in this assignment to understand a solution.
- It still gives them warnings and instructions about what to do next time.
### Cons:
- Since there may not be any "punishment," the student may not learn the appropriate lesson.
- Copying the tutorial is an unfair advantage since no other students were allowed to submit a copied solution, which is unfair to all the other students.
### Expected Dialogue:
- Me: "Thank you for meeting with me. To confirm, did you write this code? It seems to be at a higher level than I would expect."
- Student: "Yeah, I did."
- Me: "Great! Then, could you please explain this part to me?"
---
- Me: "Thank you. I see you understand all elements of your code. Now, I also know that you did not necessarily "write" it as it came straight from this tutorial. Next time, please indicate if you directly copy a solution from someone else and show that you understand each element within your submission."
- Student: "Oh, I see. I understand. I'll be sure to do that next time."
### Verse: Philippians 4:9
Whatever you have learned or received or heard from me, or seen in me—put it into practice. And the God of peace will be with you.
### First Principle: Value Learning
- Students should be rewarded if they try to learn and understand a solution to a problem, even if they did not initially create it.

# Response 3: Ask the department dean or other professors for advice
### Reasoning:
Although you can make your own judgments, you are new at this university. Ask the department dean or other professors how they handle these situations to avoid overreacting. The school might have different policies and procedures than you would typically take.
### Pros:
- Avoids over or under-reacting since they are informing what is a good course of action.
- Students would not feel it is unfair since they are following standard or school policy
### Cons:
- Could make you appear incompetent in your decision-making in these situations.
- The punishment suggested could be harsher than you initially thought, making it a more significant situation and punishment than you think it should be.
### Expected Dialogue:
- Me: "Hey, how have you been?"
- Professor: "Not bad, how are you?"
- Me: "Well, I've got a student who copied a solution from the internet and claimed it as their own... first time with plagiarism with a coding assignment. What does the school say about handling these situations? Or is it more up to you?"
- Professor: "Well, the school policy defines when it is wrong, but acceptable punishment is vague. It depends on the student and assignment, but I always emphasize that they gained an unfair advantage and how they would feel if other students got it instead of them. Then I usually give them a low score so they still get something and can recover, but enough that it matters."
- Me: "I'll keep that in mind, thanks!"
### Verse: Proverbs 15:22
Without counsel plans fail, but with many advisers they succeed.
### First Principle: Advice from others
- The dean and other professors have been here longer than you; they have dealt with this before, and it is reasonable to assume they would be willing to advise the new guy.

# My Choice:
Given all the response options, I would choose option #1.
According to the school policy, plagiarism "includes using someone else's data file as your own or representing the work of others as your own." In addition, it specifies that I mentioned in class that "taking code from another developer or site then calling it your own" is legally and morally wrong. With these in mind, it is blatantly apparent that the student committed plagiarism since they claimed it as their own, and there is almost no differentiation between the tutorial and their code. Therefore, the student should be punished regardless of whether they understand what they wrote since plagiarism is a serious situation. Simply put, they should get no credit if they plagiarize the whole assignment. In addition, this is a minor assignment, so there is still plenty of time to recover their grade.
While asking other professors or the dean is a decent idea, there is no reason to get them involved now, maybe in the future if the lesson is not learned.
