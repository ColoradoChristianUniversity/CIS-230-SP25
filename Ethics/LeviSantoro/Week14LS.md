# Question:
You are part of a development team for a software company creating a machine learning tool that can identify subtle items in large data sets. The government agency funding this tool plans to use it to identify religious references in public places that have gone unnoticed for years until put under the scrutiny of your tool. They hope to stall religious conflict by removing whatever your tool identifies through strict regulation to better secularize public places. You are excited about the success of a tool you have worked hard to perfect for years. The product manager speculates it could potentially be licensed to foreign governments in the future wanting to accomplish similar goals. However, you also have misgivings. What are three possible responses? What do you do?
# Dilemma Breakdown:
This is a challenging situation as you are a person who holds religious beliefs, but this project is attempting to secularize the world further. This is an infringement on the First Amendment right of free speech, as they are trying to suppress the output of religious messages. However, the government is funding the project while suggesting this ethical issue. Any backlash against them would require significant risk and effort due to the resources at their disposal. With the assumption that management already knows about this and has agreed to use the AI to suppress religious messages, there are three possible responses.

# Response 1: Fight back against the violation of the First Amendment
### Reasoning:
Attempting to use this tool to remove public messages is a gross infringement of Americans' First Amendment rights. As such, you should take steps to fight against it, such as hiring a civil rights attorney.

### Expected Dialogue:
- Me: "Hey, I finished up that optimization. Any news on what the government wants to use this AI?"
- Coworker: "Awesome. Yeah, I heard they want to use it on messages on buildings and signs."
- Me: "Any specific reason?"
- Coworker: "Something about removing hidden religious propaganda in public areas."
- Me: "Why would they want our technology for that?"
- Coworker: "They want to remove the hidden ones that have 'gone unnoticed for years'"
- Me: "Isn't that a major infringement on First Amendment rights?"
- Coworker: "Maybe, I'm sure they have their reasons, though."
- Me: "Well, I'm not just going to sit around and let that happen. I will fight them on this if that's the case."
- Coworker: "Good luck then, you'll need it."
### Verse: Acts 5:28-29
"Saying,Â 'We strictly charged you not to teach in this name, yet here you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and youÂ intend to bring this man's blood upon us.â€™Â But Peter and the apostles answered,Â â€˜We must obey God rather than men.â€™"
### First Principle: Maintaining your rights
- Since you live in America, you and everyone else have the right to free speech, and the government's attempt to secularize the nation in this way is infringing on this right.

# Response 2: Make plans to leave the company.
### Reasoning:
Now that you have just learned that your company is accepting funding from a source that wishes to suppress religious beliefs, you should reevaluate whether you want to be a part of that company. In short, you should not. If a company is willing to assist in secularizing the country for funding, what else are they willing to agree to? Or, if they don't know that you are religious, how will they treat you after finding out?Â  In addition, fighting back against the entire company and government is entirely unreasonable for a mere software developer.

### Expected Dialogue:
- Me: "I heard about what the government planned on doing with our AI. Are we going to let them go through with it?"
- Manager: "We have to; they provide our funding."
- Me: "Then it is with a heavy heart that I shall leave this project. I cannot bring myself to work on a project contradictory to my beliefs."
- Manager: "If so, please follow the proper procedures and give this more consideration and time before deciding so rashly."
### Verse: Proverbs 4:14
"Do not enter the path of the wicked, and do not proceed in the way of evil men."
### First Principle: Refusing to associate with the company's beliefs
- If this company is supporting the suppression of religious messages, there is no telling what else they will do. Therefore, this is a company that you should not be at.

# Response 3: Become a whistleblower and report these findings to the public
### Reasoning:
"A whistleblower is a person who draws attention to illegal or unethical practices within an organization by disclosing confidential or sensitive information." - Source: https://www.phillipsandcohen.com/how-to-be-a-whistleblower/
Attempting to wipe out supposed religious references in public is unethical, if not illegal. Therefore, by gathering information and then leaking the government's intentions to the public, those with religious beliefs could rally behind you and support your effort to prevent this from happening.

### Expected Dialogue:
- Me to SEC and CFTC: "Good afternoon. I have important information about illegal and unethical activities in the Hidden Figures company. Attached are documents showing that the government and/or company plans to use our AI to attempt to remove 'hidden religious references in the public.' This appears to be a clear violation of the First Amendment, and I await your response on how to proceed with whistleblower status."
### Verse: Romans 12:21
"Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good."
### First Principle: Attempting to stop unethical or illegal activities
- Attempting to suppress supposedly hidden religious messages could be illegal and unethical, so gathering evidence and becoming a whistleblower could be the best option to maintain your job while fighting back.

# My Choice:
Of all the options presented thus far, I would choose option 2.
As much as an underdog makes the best stories, it is not easy to fight against the government or a company as a single person due to the resources they have at their disposal. Because of this, the best option is to cut your losses and leave the company, since that is something you can completely control. As you probably noticed in my pros and cons tables, every option had MANY cons, but this option has the least harmful ones, especially when you have time to find a different job before leaving this one. It sucks to have to leave a project you put your heart and soul into, but if that project is being used for evil, you should not be associated with it.
