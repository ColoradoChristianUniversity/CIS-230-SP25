# Question:
While working as an engineer at a Consultancy, you are assigned to project using Machine Learning to improve customer efficiency. When successful, the customer plans to lay off more than 175 employees. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

# Dilemma Breakdown:
The ethical dilemma here is that directly after our convincing projection for the future, the company decided to lay off many employees. It is unclear if this occurs directly in front of us or after outside deliberation; I will assume that the client reached this incredibly impactful decision after some time, consideration, and other advice, not on a whim.

However, this decision is a problem because it appears that our projection is the direct cause of 175+ people losing their jobs and facing unexpected hardship. In addition, Christians are to help and love people, but this action would be hurting them immensely.

It is also likely that if we do not change something in our methods, the same outcome will continue to occur, causing more and more people to be laid off because of our services.

# Response 1: Do nothing
### Reasoning:
You can’t control what the customer plans to do with the information you present. In this dilemma, your job was to increase efficiency for customers with no other specifications. Therefore, laying off employees is a likely solution to improving efficiency.

For example, our projection indicates that due to current management, the customer service call center is currently wasting customer time. In addition, it will be too small to handle the number of complaints in the future, and hiring new staff would be incredibly expensive as a future solution. Therefore, an automated complaint system and FAQ website should be created to handle future problems. If this solution is implemented, staff will be reduced once the website and new system are completed since the current number of customer service line workers would be costly to keep around as most of them will not have enough work after a while.

Should reducing staff be the response every company should take every single time? No, but that's not your decision; that’s the customer’s decision after hearing your projections and seriously considering your presented data.

### Pros:
- Ensure your company produces the best consultation by leaving layoff as a solution.
- Knowledge that your projection has opened the client’s eyes to customer inefficiencies since the projection was successful.
	- Possibly increase your company's reputation for a job well done.
- In an extreme case, this attitude could save the company from going under by removing unnecessary staff and costs.
- Minimal guilt for the client's actions since you merely presented the data for them to decide.
### Cons:
- Noting is done to help the 175 employees and their families.
- Clients might continue laying people off as a solution if nothing changes.
### Expected Dialogue:
- Coworker: "Hey! Did you see that the most recent customer planned to lay off more than 175 employees?"
- Me: "No, I didn't. I wonder if our projection influenced them to do that."
- Coworker: "Maybe, I wonder if an entire division or role was deemed inefficient or no longer useful."
- Me: "Or maybe they are completely unrelated; something else might have come up. Maybe the market changed."
- Coworker: "Maybe. Any thought on it?"
- Me: "Well, we were tasked with projecting solutions to future customer efficiency problems; we didn't know exactly what they would do with it or if we had any effect on the layoff in the first place."
- Coworker: "Yeah, I guess you're right."
### Verse: Colossians 3:23
"Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men,"
### First Principle: Doing Your Job
- The job description did not intend to lay people off; the company may or may not have responded to your work that way, which is either out of your control or possibly the best solution for them.

# Response 2: Find out why
### Reasoning:
After hearing that the company plans to put so many people out of a job, inquire why this company is laying people off.
- Was it because of the projection we created that laying off employees would increase customer efficiency?
- Is it because they currently can't afford their employees?
- Or are they laying people off to generate more profits
Gathering this information will lead to a better future decision, such as:  
- If you want to continue this job with the consequences
- If this is an area of focus you can capitalize on since most other consulting companies miss it
- If there are ways you can change the program to prevent this response in the future. 
### Pros:
- Being able to learn why your work suggested laying people off.
- Able to gather new information and respond to future jobs accordingly.
- This could prevent layoffs from occurring in the future.
### Cons:
- Could annoy the customer as this information is none of your business.
- Could get fired for poking around in the customer’s confidential business.
### Expected Dialogue:
- Me: "Hey! I heard that the most recent client planned to do a substantial layoff. Do you know why that is the case?"
- Coworker: "No idea. You could ask them, but they probably wouldn't tell you anything they don't have to."
---
- Me: "Hello. Since the projection, I was informed that you began plans to lay off a large number of employees and would like to inquire if that is the solution our company's projection induced."
- Customer Contact: "Hello! Your projection proved very insightful, and we are taking steps to follow it. Unfortunately, since it's confidential, I can't say the exact answer to why the layoffs are occurring. Have a nice day!"
### Verse: Matthew 18:15
"If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother."
### First Principle: Information
- Knowing more about why the customer is doing this will best prepare you going forward if you wish to modify anything about your projections.
# Response 3: Change Projection Strategy
### Reasoning:
The sudden layoffs are a problematic outcome based on your projection. Therefore, you should change your strategy when presenting the predictions immediately.  

By emphasizing the utility and new placement of existing human resources within the company or avoiding the idea of removing employees, the layoff problem could be prevented in the future.
### Pros:
- Use this outcome as a learning opportunity & a reality check for all future consultations.
- Implementing this strategy could minimize potential layoffs from your projections in the future.
- Possibly thousands of people would be able to keep their jobs over the course of your job customers.
### Cons:
- Laying off people could be the best solution for bloated companies, and this action attempts to prevent that solution.
- The company could lay people off regardless, and this only reduces the program's strength.
- Might get reprimanded for suggesting this idea if it hinders profits or service quality.
- Additionally, it might not be an option if your supervisor disagrees with the idea unless you wish to lose your job.
### Expected Dialogue:
- Me: "Hey, can we severely limit layoffs as a solution for future projections? There are ways employees can adapt to change or learn new jobs. I hate seeing people endure that hardship because of our ideas."
- Coworker: "Won't that minimize the program's impact?"
- Me: "Possibly, but people would keep their jobs."
- Coworker: "I get where you are coming from, but our job is to increase customer efficiency. Decreasing the amount of people in an area could increase customer efficiency."
- Me: "I don't think a small increase in efficiency is worth people losing their jobs."
- Coworker: "Maybe so, but you will need to attempt to convince the supervisor before implementing a  change of that magnitude."
### Verse: Romans 14:13
"Therefore let us not pass judgment on one another any longer, but rather decide never to put a stumbling block or hindrance in the way of a brother."
### First Principle: Future Prevention
- If the problem is addressed now, many people's jobs will be saved in the future.

# My Choice:
Out of these options, I believe option 2 is the path to follow. Inquiring about future information would benefit my conscience and future projections.

However, I understand that receiving information about why a company is choosing to lay off employees is entirely unrealistic since they have no reason to disclose that information. Therefore, in the likely event that no information is gleaned, I follow option 3. By changing your presentation methods, you can implant the idea of utilizing the company's workers for other roles rather than leaving the poor workers out to dry.
