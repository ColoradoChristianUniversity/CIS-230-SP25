# Question:
A junior engineer at your company, leveraging advanced Artificial Intelligence, has completed a critical software project well ahead of schedule. The AI has written almost the entire application, raising questions about the engineer's understanding of the project's intricacies. Despite this, the company's management, impressed by the speedy delivery, is planning to integrate this AI-generated software into major systems immediately. You are concerned but you are also friends with this junior developer. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

# Dilemma Breakdown:
Due to the current limitations of generative AI, any program written mainly through AI should be scrutinized for various reasons. First and foremost, the code could have an inconsistency no human would make or add bloat because of poor optimizations. In addition, it is possible that the AI stole the code from somewhere else, causing unintentional plagiarism and potential legal issues.
However, as a developer hired at this company, it is reasonable to assume that the junior developer also knows this. Therefore, it is also sensible to believe that the developer submitted his work with certainty, understands generally how the code works and what it is doing, and is confident the code could be implemented since he submitted it for approval. For this dilemma, you have confirmed that they used AI, are open about it, and are confident in its implementation. In addition, it is reasonable that there is some sort of code check, however small, for when software programs are ready to be implemented into the main systems and that it has passed this test.
However, as much as you like the junior developer, it is reasonable to worry about the impact this software could have, especially with how many systems management wishes to add this software. With all this in mind, I believe there are three reasonable responses to this situation:

# Response 1: Ask management to hold off for a final code review & quick test
### Reasoning:
A program written primarily by AI is concerning, and while the junior developer has skills, the code should be checked and tested before running on any major systems. This assumes that it passed all the routine checks, but with the importance of the systems management wants to add this software to, it wouldn't hurt to double-check to ensure nothing catastrophic happens. 
### Pros:
- Possibly save the company from massive failures down the line.
- Possibly save the reputation of the junior developer if something catastrophic would have happen.
- Assurance that everything is up to par and ready for implementation when confirmed.
### Cons:
- Junior developer could see this as you not trusting them or their work, harming your relationship.
- If everything is shown to be correct, your reputation could be hurt by preventing an early update.
- Prevents the features this software provides even more, possibly hurting developers or users.
### Expected Dialogue:
- Me: "Hey, supervisor, has the software the junior developer wrote been implemented anywhere yet? I heard that management wants to put it anywhere it can."
- Supervisor: "No, not yet; why do you ask?"

- Me: "Well, I say this not to downplay their skills but as genuine concern for the systems it's being integrated into. They said it is ready and has passed approval, but I would like to request a final test before it is implemented since it was primarily written by AI. We don't want to miss anything and have every system crash and burn because of a small mistake."
- Supervisor: "Yeah, makes sense. I'll consider your suggestion when talking to management."
### Verse: Proverbs 23:4
"Do not toil to acquire wealth; be discerning enough to desist."
### First Principle: Assurance and Insurance
- Assurance that the software works and insurance if anything goes wrong beyond that.

# Response 2: Ask management to integrate the code at a smaller scare first
### Reasoning:
According to the dilemma, management wishes to integrate the new software into major systems immediately. However, this is a risky move with the knowledge that the code was primarily AI-generated. Whether you trust the developer's code and the system to produce usable software, going all-in on new software in critical systems is not a good idea.
Instead, the software should be implemented slowly, in smaller systems first or only in one critical system at a time.
### Pros:
- Mitigates the risks associated with implementing new software. 
- If something goes wrong, it is easier to isolate what the problem is and where it came from.
- Partial implementation allows for critical updates to be passed in before full implementation. 
### Cons:
- Slow implementation could not be an option or increase the risks depending on the software.
- The problems could be hidden until fully implemented, causing this suggestion to be a waste of time.
### Expected Dialogue:
- Me: "Hey, supervisor, has the software the junior developer wrote been implemented anywhere yet? I heard that management wants to put it anywhere it can."
- Supervisor: "No, not yet; why do you ask?"
- Me: "Well, doesn't that seem risky? I know new software never goes wrong, as we all have experienced, but immediately integrating into several critical systems?"
- Supervisor: "I guess so. What do you suggest?"
- Me: "I feel like the software should be implemented slower, maybe in less important systems first or only one critical system to start."
- Supervisor: "I'm sure they have their reasons for the decision, but I'll consider your suggestion when talking to management."
### Verse: Galatians 6:9
"Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up.”
### First Principle: Easing into change
- Full implementation off the bat is a risky move; easing into the implementation might avoid serious problems down the line.

# Response 3: Trust the junior developer's work & judgment
### Reasoning:
The junior developer is still a developer, and they should understand the risks associated with using AI. They should know that AI is not perfect, and they should know that they should understand every line that is written using generative AI. If the developer is willing to risk their reputation on this critical software submission without checking and testing it, they shouldn't be working here, no matter what you think of them. Therefore, you should trust the developer's judgment and the system to implement new code to account for catastrophic mistakes.
### Pros:
- Keep yourself out of responsibility if something goes wrong; they should have known the dangers.
- Causes no delays in the implementation of this critical software.
### Cons:
- By not interfering, nothing is stopping the systems from crashing and burning if something goes wrong.
- If something goes wrong, it is probably your responsibility to help fix it, causing you more work.
### Expected Dialogue:
- Coworker: "Hey, do you know if the software the junior developer wrote has been implemented anywhere yet? I heard that management wants to put it anywhere it can."
- Me: "No, not yet. Why do you ask?"
- Coworker: "Well, doesn't that seem like a risky idea?"
- Me: "Listen, I have faith the junior developer knows how their code runs, even if AI made it. They risk their entire career if they copy the code and do nothing else with it. In addition, management should probably learn a thing or two about why rushing into new code is a bad idea. If anything goes wrong, it will be a valuable learning experience for everyone and more work for us over the next 2-4 weeks."
### Verse: Proverbs 14:16
"One who is wise is cautious and turns away from evil, but a fool is reckless and careless."
### First Principle: Responsibility
- Let people be responsible for their actions and take responsibility when things go wrong.
# My Choice:
Given the options presented thus far, I would choose option 2.
Developers should know what is written within their code and how it works; I am not responsible for double-checking their work. If something goes wrong, the junior developer should be the one who understands what their code is doing and how it impacts the system. That is the most BASIC principle taught to programmers about AI. If that rule is not followed, they should not be a programmer in a business. In addition, it could appear demeaning to ask for a complete review of their code again, possibly for the second time. However, I disagree with management's decision to immediately implement it into several critical systems. Therefore, I would like to know if it is better to implement the software slower. Yet, if there is a legitimate reason as to why the software needs to be implemented all at once, I will respect the decision, and back off.
