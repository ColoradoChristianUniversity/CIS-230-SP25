# Question:
You are a software engineer working for a marketing firm that has been hired by a tobacco company to analyze data for a new product. Your team is excited to work on this project because it could save your struggling company during a bad economy. However, you suspect the customer is intending the product for young audiences, but you are not sure. To make matters worse, you have been trying to build a relationship with a coworker who has criticized religion as judgmental; you are worried that taking a moral stand against this product could come across as hypocritical and cause you to lose the opportunity to reach him just as he is softening to spiritual conversations. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

# Dilemma Breakdown:
In this dilemma, you want to stand against associating with a company that sells immoral products. These products are highly addictive, the leading cause of cancer, and cause a myriad of health detriments. This is even worse if the company asks you to assist in marketing these products to younger people, which is in their best interest for higher profits. However, taking a stand could come across as judgmental to the coworker you are attempting to disciple, which is their main qualm with religion. This is further exemplified in that this business deal would save the company from a miserable year, possibly preventing layoffs from your job. With all this in mind, there are three reasonable responses.

# Response 1: Take a stand, this has nothing to do with religion

### Reasoning:
First and foremost, it is entirely unethical to associate with a business whose products are highly addictive and the leading cause of cancer. In addition, it is even more unethical if those things even have a chance of being marketed to teenagers. Though the coworker may see this as judgmental from you, these judgments are not about religion, but rather caring about the safety, health, and well-being of others.

| âœ… Pros | ðŸš« Cons |
| --- | --- |
| Judgment does not directly stem from religion.                                | Could appear judgmental to the coworker.                                   |
| Attempting to do something about an ethical problem rather than sitting back. | Company will have great difficulties if this business does not go through. |
| Not associating your business with harmful and addictive substances.          |                                                                            |
### Expected Dialogue:
- Manager: "Anything else about the project proposal?"
- Me: "Actually, before we end, I must say that I do not think our company should associate with this type of business."
- Coworker: "Really? Your 'religion' is trying to get in the way of the biggest business opportunity we have this year?"
- Me: "With all due respect, religion has little to do with this stance. I believe we should not improve the business of highly addictive products that happen to be the leading cause of cancer. I care about the safety, health, and well-being of others, especially when it was implied that this would be marketed towards late teens and early twenties."
### Verse: 1 Peter 4:14
"If you are insulted for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you."
### First Principle: Taking a stand against this business
- Tobacco products are the leading cause of cancer and cause a myriad of other health issues

# Response 2: Investigate further if it is truly marketed toward younger people
### Reasoning:
One question and piece of information will determine your next action, specifically if the marketing is to a younger audience. The prompt very specifically says that you are not sure if it is marketed to younger audiences, and the answer to that leads to drastically different responses. If it is, you should attempt to not associate with them as much as possible since that is a serious ethical concern. On the other hand, if it is not, you should reconsider how much standing up for this means to you and what exactly you will be doing on this project. Adults can make their own decisions, and if your company doesn't do it, someone else will. Therefore, you should get the answer before making any other decision.

| âœ… Pros | ðŸš« Cons |
| --- | --- |
| More information leads to better decisions.                  | Does not solve the problem.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  |
| Provides flexibility and assurance for the ultimate decision | Might not be able to get an answer. |
### Expected Dialogue:
- Me: "Excuse me, can I tell you something really quick?"
- Manager: "Yes, what is it?"
- Me: "I just want to clarify with you, who exactly is the target audience for this project?"
- Manager: "Unfortunately, they haven't told me many details yet, but I should get that information soon. Why do you ask?"
- Me: "From the meetings, it appears to be directed towards younger people. If that is true, I would have a rather large moral dilemma working on this project."
- Manager: "I see. Well, you and everyone else will find out soon. Everyone else is excited about the project cause it will save our company this year. Maybe you should be, too."
- Me: "Understood. Thank You."
### Verse: Proverbs 18:15
"An intelligent heart acquires knowledge, and the ear of the wise seeks knowledge."
### First Principle: Getting information
- In an ethical dilemma, unknowns are the worst thing you could have, so clearing up the biggest one should be your first course of action.

# Response 3: Ask not to work on this project
### Reasoning:
Though business has not been great at the company, there is always work to be done somewhere, hopefully work that does not conflict with your moral values. Therefore, the best way to avoid the ethical dilemma is to not participate as much as possible by working on a different project. This way, you do not aid the addictive and dangerous product, and you can avoid the judgment of the coworker if it is known you were not assigned to this project. However, the company might be small enough that this may not be an option.

| âœ… Pros | ðŸš« ConsÂ |
| --- | --- |
| Allows the company to keep the deal.                   | Might not be an option.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  |
| Avoids interacting with the crux of the moral dilemma. | Not being seen as a team player.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  |
| Possibly avoids the judgment of the coworker.          | Possibly incurs the judgment of the coworker.Â Â   |
|                                                        | Possibly have to do it anyway or lose your job.  |
### Expected Dialogue:
- Me: "Excuse me, can I tell you something really quick?"
- Manager: "Yes, what is it?"
- Me: "I must say that I do not think our company should associate with this type of business."
- Manager: " *Sigh*. We do not have a choice, you know what type of year we have had."
- Me: "Yes, which is why I want to be put on a different project. I feel that it is morally wrong to work with a company that sells a highly addictive product, which happens to be the leading cause of cancer, especially when it appeared that we would be marketing towards late teens and early twenties."
- Manager: "I see. Unfortunately, that might not be an option. I will see what I can do."
### Verse: Proverbs 4:14
"Do not enter the path of the wicked, and do not proceed in the way of evil men."
### First Principle: Not associating with evil
- Though most likely impossible to run away from it entirely, you should attempt to not associate with products that do significant harm to the people that use them, and this company is one of the most egregious offenders.

# My Choice:
From all the options presented, option 2 is the best choice.
The main reason I choose this option is because it gives flexibility as to the response of possibly unethical marketing. I assumed it was towards younger people in all the other options, since it would be the most profitable. If the answer to the question is yes, I would choose one of these two options next. In addition, while I don't like the thought of working with tobacco products at all, I would consider doing nothing harder if it were not towards younger people, since mature adults can make their own decisions. Not taking this deal could cause more problems than it would solve, especially since they would go elsewhere if the company declines.
