# Question:
While writing some code Saturday night, you realize you have introduced a crippling bug that breaks the entire system. As a Christian, you have politely requested no deadlines, meetings or work ever occur on Sunday. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

# Dilemma Breakdown:
This dilemma focuses on the conflict between your commitment to the Sabbath as a Christian and fixing the bug that impacts the rest of the development team for this project. On the one hand, you have asked for (and most likely repeated) no work on Sundays. On the other hand, you were the one who created the bug that broke the entire system and could detrimentally impact the workflow of the team. In addition, the bug could affect the users for a whole day, possibly longer, which would cost money and customer goodwill. With this conflict in mind, one assumption I will make is that the code written this Saturday night is the direct cause of the bug. With this in mind, I believe there are three reasonable responses to this situation:

# Response 1: Attempt to fix the bug that night
### Reasoning:
There was no time specified when you discovered this bug in the dilemma; therefore, it is reasonable to assume there is time left in the night for you to be able to fix it. However, since bug fixing makes up a large portion of a developer's coding time, removing this bug could be a multi-hour endeavor and could cause you to push past midnight into your sabbath. However, I don't consider the next day to ‚Äústart‚Äù until I go to bed, so working late on Saturday doesn't feel like working on Sunday.

| ‚úÖ Pros ¬†| üö´ Cons ¬†|
| -------- | --------- |
| You ensure the job gets done right. | Possibly losing sleep over the commitment.¬† |
| It might go past midnight, but it doesn't feel like "working the sabbath." | Staying up late hinders your ability to solve problems, making this fix take longer. |
| Only minor delays for the feature implementation | If you cannot fix the bug, staying up could be for nothing. |
| Makes sure that no one else will run into the bug tomorrow.¬†|¬†¬†¬† This problem could persist for many hours, causing you to lose sleep or time with your family. |
### Expected Dialogue:
- Me: "Here is the feature you wanted to be implemented. Sorry, it's a bit late. After developing the feature, I had to patch a critical level bug."
- Supervisor: "Good catch, thanks. It will be implemented soon."
### Verse: Hebrews 13:17
Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they are keeping watch over your souls, as those who will have to give an account. Let them do this with joy and not with groaning, for that would be of no advantage to you.
### First Principle: Getting things done before Sunday
- Though it's late, getting things done before Sunday starts or feels like it starts avoids the issue altogether, even if there is a cost of sleep or time.

# Response 2: Make an exception and fix it tomorrow
### Reasoning:
Because it is essential to get proper rest and maintain a healthy work-life balance while ensuring your code does not impair the users or the rest of the development team, it can be seen as reasonable to break the sabbath to fix this critical bug. In addition, it can be assumed that your agreement asked that no work be expected or assigned to you on Sundays. Since no one is forcing you to fix your mistake and not fixing this bug would negatively impact many people, a brief fix couldn't hurt that much.

| ‚úÖ Pros¬† | üö´ Cons¬† |
| -------- | --------- |
| Better work-life balance. | Less sabbath time for the next day and less time with friends or family. |
| A slightly delayed fix, but still a timely fix to cause minimal issues. | It could change expectations of your agreement since it shows you can work on Sundays. |
### Expected Dialogue:
- Me: "Sorry for the delay. Here's the patch for the critical bug I found."
- Supervisor: "That's surprising. I thought you couldn't work Sundays."
- Me: "I made an exception because it was my critical mistake; I'm logging off for the rest of the day."
- Supervisor: "Sure things, thanks."
### Verse: Matthew 12:11
He said to them,¬†‚ÄúWhich one of you who has a sheep¬†if it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will not take hold of it and lift it out?"
### First Principle: Making an exception to help others
- Though squashing the bug is not healing on the Sabbath, you are still helping others on the Sabbath by fixing your critical mistake.

# Response 3: Request a revert to the version before you introduced the bug
### Reasoning:
Reverting versions to avoid system crashing bugs is nothing new in the tech world, so why couldn't your code just be temporarily reverted to preserve the system's integrity until Monday? Since the code you wrote tonight is directly causing the bug, removing the code until it can be appropriately fixed is the most straightforward solution. This answer assumes that the code was uploaded to the system, so simply not implementing the code is a similar solution. However, since I have never worked in an official team development workplace like this, my pros and cons will be assumptions of issues that could arise.

| ‚úÖPros | üö´Cons |
| ------ | ------- |
| Possibly the quickest solution. A small reversion or not implementing the code. | It could revert some of the other developers' work, halting progress. |
| Possibly the easiest solution. This would push the brunt of the work for later. | If the reversion is not possible, it still impacts everyone and brings a bad reputation to your beliefs since they negatively impact productivity. |
| Saves you sleep tonight instead of working on it throughout the night. | The deadline could have been for tonight; therefore, this will cause delays.|
|¬†¬†¬†¬†       ¬†¬† | Possibly not an option. |
### Expected Dialogue:
- Me: "Hey! Last night, I was working on developing the new feature, and by the time I realized something was wrong, I was done with its development and implemented it into the main. Would it be possible to revert my implementation so I can fix it on Monday?"
- Supervisor: "Okay, that will cause some delays. Can't you fix it tomorrow?"
- Me: "As previously stated, I do not wish to work on Sundays. Reverting my additions until I can fix them later appears to be the quickest and easiest solution."
- Supervisor: "I wouldn‚Äôt be so sure, but I'll see what I can do about reverting your code."
### Verse: 1 John 1:9
If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness
### First Principle: removing just the problem until it can be fixed
- Reverting the version removes the system-breaking bug until you can properly fix it within your designated hours.

# My Choice:
Of all the options presented thus far and with the assumptions and parameters of the dilemma, I would choose option 3. The dilemma does not specify that you are under any time pressure with this code, and the only assumption is that the bug was caused by the current code, which is reasonable considering the wording of the dilemma. Therefore, simply reverting the version or not uploading the code provides time to fix the critical bug, ¬†a healthy work-life balance, and avoiding work on Sunday.
