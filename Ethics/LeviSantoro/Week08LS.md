# Question:
While working on an engineering team, you mentor a teammate for 6 months to no avail, he is just not catching on. You learn he is up for a raise as company leadership has mistakenly given him sole credit for work you have done together. What are three possible responses? What do you do?
# Dilemma Breakdown:
The dilemma with this situation is that the teammate is receiving full credit for work that you both completed, which is made worse by his lack of understanding or effort. In addition, this teammate is receiving a promotion off credit they should not receive and skills they do not have. Therefore, it appears to be a bad decision for the company to promote someone who is not ready but immensely prideful and rude to speak up about someone else's inadequacy and attempt to receive the credit "you deserve." Therefore, I believe there are three reasonable responses

# Response 1: Determine the cause of the mix-up and rectify it.
### Reasoning:
Because you did not receive any credit for your work, there had to be a mistake or miscommunication somewhere down the line. Therefore, regardless of any benefit you might receive or take away from your teammate, you should attempt to fix the error in the future.

| Makes sure this miscommunication does not happen again | Appears to be discrediting the work of your teammate                           |
| Receiving the credit you deserve.                      | Appears to be prideful in demanding the credit you deserve                     |
|                                                        | Possibly deny the teammate a promotion that would align with his skills better |
### Expected Dialogue:
- Coworker: "Hey! Did you hear that your teammate is up for promotion? The project he did caught the attention of the higher-ups."
- Me: "He is? That's peculiar. I had quite a difficult time teaching him, and I still don't know how much he grasped."
- Coworker: "Oh, you also worked on that project?"
- Me: "Yeah, why?"
- Coworker: "They never mentioned you; they said he did it alone. That was the reason he's up for promotion."
- Me: "Who did you hear that information from? I should probably set the record straight and prevent that miscommunication from happening again. And... they might not be ready for that promotion."
### Verse: Galatians 6:9
- “Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up.”
### First Principle: Fixing the miscommunication
- Regardless of getting your credit, everyone should get the credit they deserve, and you should attempt to prevent this miscommunication from happening again.

# Response 2: Talk to the teammate about the promotion
### Reasoning:
Because the teammate had immense trouble grasping the concepts after mentoring them for six months, ensuring they understand the situation could protect them in the long run. If the teammate has some self-awareness, they could realize that they might not be ready for the position because of the circumstances. A small talk could help bring these realizations out, steer them in the right direction, or solidify their stance on the position.

| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Removes most of the responsibility from yourself if things go wrong after the promotion. | Management could turn to you if things go wrong since you mentored him. |
| Respects the autonomy of the teammate.                                                   | Does not get you any credit for the work you performed.                 |
|                                                                                          | Appears to undermine the teammate's skills.                             |
### Expected Dialogue:
- Me: "Hey! I saw you were up for promotion because of the project. Congratulations!"
- Teammate: "Thanks. I hope to get a bump in pay finally."
- Me: "Yeah. But, just as a friend, are you sure this is a good idea?"
- Teammate: "Of course, why wouldn’t it be?”
- Me: “Recently, you've struggled quite a bit with this kind of work. Do you think it's a good idea to take on more of the same work, not to mention more responsibility?”
- Teammate: “I know I’ve been struggling, but this promotion will be better for me in the long run."
- Me: "If you say so, good luck then."
### Verse: Proverbs 13:11
"Wealth gained hastily will dwindle, but whoever gathers little by little will increase it."
### First Principle: Get the teammate to self-evaluate
- You should gently ask if they think this is a good idea, but let them take the position if they truly believe they are ready for the promotion.

# Response 3: Do nothing. It’s the teammate’s decision

### Reasoning:

The dilemma does not specify the nature of this promotion, yet there is no reason to get involved in either position. If the promotion is the one you were hoping for, management will learn what happens when they don't assign proper credit and put an inexperienced person in a higher position. On the other hand, since you mentored this teammate, it is unlikely you would be competing for the same position, so the promotion has nothing to do with you.

| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Respects the autonomy of the teammate and does not undermine them in any way. | Does not get you any credit for the work you performed & do not learn why you did not receive credit. |
| Least amount of work for you; just let things ride out.                       | Management could turn to you if things go wrong since you were the one mentoring him.                 |

- Me: "That isn't a regular occurrence, is it? People not getting credit for the work they did?"
- Coworker: "Not particularly."
- Me: "Then, considering his knowledge, he'll either learn to succeed in his new position or understand what he's getting himself into before it goes wrong next time."
### Verse: Proverbs 29:11
- "A fool gives full vent to his spirit, but a wise man quietly holds it back."
### First Principle: They will fly or flounder
- If the teammate accepts this position, they will either fly or flounder in it; it was the management's decision, and it will be the management's responsibility if things go wrong.

# My Choice:
Given all the options presented thus far, I choose option 1. Since the problem does not specify what kind of promotion the teammate is receiving and since you are his "mentor," it can be assumed that it is unrelated to you. Therefore, the best option would be to learn why you did not receive any credit and attempt to prevent it. Once that is resolved, what management does with that information is none of your business, and there is no longer reason to interfere. However, if we were going for the same promotion, I would advocate for myself harder to receive the credit I earned.
