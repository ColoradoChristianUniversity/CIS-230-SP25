# Question:

You're a software engineer in America. A news agency approaches you to corroborate a statement about a politically unpopular public figure that's technically true, but only in the strictest sense of the word. You suspect their agenda is to publicly cancel this person. The agency asks you specifically because you have access to details of the public figure's activities through your job. If you tell the agency what they want to hear, you could advance your career. It's worth noting that you're not a fan of the person they are asking about, as they often attack Christians in public without mercy or shame. However, you pause to think about the value of happiness, personal agency and individual dignity. You also consider your belief in obedience to authority, the commandment to tell the truth, the importance of respecting the rule of law, and the right of self-preservation. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

# Dilemma Breakdown:
In this dilemma, you know the agenda of this news agency is to cancel this politician, which is a fate you would wish upon no one. You would be a direct cause of that fate. However, you do not like this person and they have openly opposed your faith, so is it that bad if the media can get some dirt on him? With this in mind, there are three reasonable responses to the situation.

# Response 1: Dismiss the news agency
### Reasoning:
You should not be involved in gossiping about and canceling someone, no matter what you think about the person. Being canceled by the media and culture is a horrific experience; regardless of what the person has done, no one should have to undergo it. Therefore, when the news asks questions to slander the politician, you should move on and walk away. In fact, this might be precisely what the media wants; refusing to comment might make the politician more guilty.

| Not answering the question could also give the media exactly what they want. | Missing out on a career opportunity                                                |
### Expected Dialogue:
- Media: "Excuse me, sir, you work for the software department, correct?"
- Me: "Yes, how can I help you?"
- Media: "Can you confirm that Governor Glorkenshpiel's campaign used the same analytics tools in past controversial election investigations?"
- Me: "Unfortunately, I cannot answer that. Good day. "
- Media: "Sir, wait! Please answer the question."
- Me: "..."
### Verse: James 4:11-12
"Do not speak evil against one another, brothers. The one who speaks against a brother or judges his brother, speaks evil against the law and judges the law. But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but a judge. There is only one lawgiver and judge, he who is able to save and to destroy. But who are you to judge your neighbor?"
### First Principle: Let God judge
- It is too risky to respond to them. In addition, we are called to let God judge, which will occur in due time; you do not need to give the media more reason to judge him.

# Response 2: Tell the truth, not what they want to hear
### Reasoning:
You have information, and they are trying to get it from you. However, you should not embellish or feed into the media, maintain professionalism, and speak the truth as it is. Answer only the questions they ask, or point them in the direction of where to look. If this truthful information could excel your career, it's worth taking the risk, especially since the politician is so discriminatory against your religion. Besides, the media attempts to cancel politicians all the time; this was going to happen anyway.

| Assisting in the cancellation of your anti-Christian politician. | Telling this information to the public could violate previous agreements or contracts. |
### Expected Dialogue:
- Media: "Excuse me, sir, you work for the software department, correct?"
- Me: "Yes, how can I help you?"
- Media: "Can you confirm that Governor Glorkenshpiel's campaign used the same analytics tools in past controversial election investigations?"
- Me: "Yes, his campaign did."
- Media: "That is all, thank you for your time."
### Verse: Ephesians 4:25
"Therefore, having put away falsehood, let each one of you speak the truth with his neighbor, for we are members one of another."
### First Principle: Speaking the truth to punish evil
- There should be no reason to avoid speaking the truth, and if it leads to the judgment of someone loudly opposed to Christianity, so be it.

# Response 3: Evaluate the information they want and respond accordingly
### Reasoning:
Many answers would be correct depending on the information they are requesting in this dilemma. Therefore, you should analyze the answer carefully before responding when they ask the question. For example, if the answer they are looking for is classified or breaks contracts you signed, you should keep quiet. If they are requesting public information, then there is no harm in giving it to them. Of course, there are a million different situations in between, but when it comes to answers they are ashamed of or hope people never find out, maybe they should not have done it in the first place.

- Me: "Yes, how can I help you?"
- Media: "Can you confirm that Governor Glorkenshpiel's campaign used the same analytics tools in past controversial election investigations?"
- Me: "If you mean Excel, I would tell you to consider other reasons that might be used."
- Media: "And what ways would those be?"
- Me: "Analyzing data. Thank you, that will be all."
### Verse: James 1:19
"Know this, my beloved brothers: let every person be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger;"
### First Principle: Thinking before speaking
- This is a delicate situation; a wrong move could cost you your job, reputation, or both. Therefore, reacting to the question should be the first principle in this situation.

# My Choice:
Given all the responses presented, option 1 is the best one.
As stated in option 1, we should not judge others since judgment is for God. Therefore, you should not give the media any information since that would give them more ammunition to judge the politician. In addition, remaining silent on the issue may be more incriminating for the politician, depending on the question, which is a win on both sides.
