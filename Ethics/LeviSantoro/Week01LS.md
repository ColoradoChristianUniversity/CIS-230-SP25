# Question:
While working as an engineer at a Credit Card company, you are tasked to resolve problems experienced by your employer’s second largest customer: a well-known pornography web site. Resolving their problems will not only reduce their frustration but should make them considerably more efficient and profitable. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

# Dilemma Breakdown:
- The difficulty of this question comes from two main sources, the company and the consequences for not accepting the project.
- First, the dilemma states that the company is a well-known pornography site, and that taking this project on will increase its efficiency and profitability. We Christians believe that the practice of pornography is one of the worst sinful acts on this earth and this company chooses to profit off this sin, therefore assisting them appears to be assisting in sin.
- Secondly, although it is not spelled out, refusal to do this project could tarnish your reputation or possibly get you fired. Assuming you are also providing for a family, there is a good possibility that you could no longer provide for your family if you refuse in the wrong way.
# Response 1: Ask to be put onto another project
### Reasoning:
- By making the site more efficient, profitable, and enjoyable, you are enabling the sinful act.
- Therefore, explain your ethical concerns and ask to be put onto a different project instead.
### Pros:
- It informs your boss of your ethical concerns working on this project.
- It maintains the possibility of keeping your job, requiring no immediate ultimatum.
- If worded in the right way, the expression of concern is reasonable and respectful
### Cons:
- This does not immediately solve the problem
- It is up to your boss to progress the information and make a decision.
- You might have to consider every response to this question because waiting for a response leaves less time to make a final decision if there are time constraints.
- The boss could not care about your concerns and request you do it anyways, under the threat of job termination.
### Expected Dialogue:
- Me: Hey! I saw the task you assigned me for an upcoming request. Unfortunately, I don't feel comfortable taking on this task due it conflicting with my ethical standards, would you be able to assign me to a different project?
- Boss: Thank you for letting me know your concerns, I'll talk with some people and let you know about possibly getting reassigned, but that might not be an option.
- Me: Understood, once a final decision comes through, I will respond accordingly.
### Verse: Proverbs 4:14
"Do not enter the path of the wicked
And do not proceed in the way of evil men."
### First Principle: Awareness
This option best shows awareness for your moral stance to your boss, the company's principles, and more information is given if you make an ultimatum decision. 
# Response 2: Complete the project to the best of your ability
### Reasoning:
- We are called to be excellent in all we do.
- Servants are called to respect and serve their masters. In this case, employees are to respect and serve their bosses.
- Although it feels bad you are helping them, since you yourself are not the one actively creating and spreading the deeds, all is well.
### Pros:
- No worries about keeping your job
- A small possibility of receiving benefits or more jobs of a similar caliber since few others would choose to take on the projects.
- Possible reward for satisfying a large customer so they keep using your company.
### Cons:
- Possible guilt of assisting a pornography site's efficiency.
- Responsibility of the project and the consequences if this big deal does not go through.
### Expected Dialogue:
- Me; Hey! I saw the assignment you gave me; it looks like a major customer! I'll be sure to do my best on it to make sure they keep coming back.
- Boss: Thanks, I'll send you more details about your assignment soon.
### Verse: 1 Peter 2:18
"Servants, be subject to your masters with all respect, not only to the good and gentle but also to the unjust."
### First Principle: Excellence
We are called to respect our masters, bosses in this case, by doing the tasks they assign to the best of our abilities.
# Response 3: Refuse & leave the company
### Reasoning:
Pornography is one of man's worst sins, it makes sure to ruin every single aspect of life. Therefore, a company that chooses to take them on for business does not have the best moral stances, regardless of how much they are offering.
The best action here then is to remove yourself from not just the project, but the company itself, regardless of the consequences. The Bible commanding us many times to reject wicked camaraderie and sin, so the correct option is to leave the company all together to find one.
### Pros:
- A clear conscience
- An opportunity to find a better job
- An opportunity to practice reliance on God
### Cons:
- Leaving a job. And EVERYTHING that comes with that.
	- Not being able to provide.
	- Job hunting.
	- Benefits & the consequences of their removal.
- Being blacklisted by the company or other companies for your reasoning and decision to leave.
### Expected Dialogue:
- Me: Good afternoon, after hearing about the details of the project, I believe it is against my morals to take this project on and be employed by a company who determines that it is ok to accept these types of clients. I would like to discuss my 2 weeks’ notice as soon as possible.
- Boss: Let’s have a meeting about this decision and the consequences if you follow through.
### Verse: 1 Corinthians 15:33
"Do not be deceived: “Bad company ruins good morals.""
### First Principle: Maintaining Morals
By doing this extreme level of action, you are making sure to separate yourself from a company who chooses to take business from one of the most disgusting enablers of sin.
# My Choice: Option 1
- This option provides the best blend of keeping your job while maintaining a clean moral slate. With most companies only caring about profits, it's difficult to find a company who doesn't work with those types of people, especially the large ones. Therefore, the only actions you can control are your own, and creating a system that would make the pornography company by making it more efficient and profitable is an action that should not be taken.
- We as Christians are called not to associate with the wicked, and the ultimatum I would choose would be to risk being fired. Although it would be scary, I would trust that God would have a plan for me and whomever I am providing for since I am turning away from sin.
