# Weekly Question:

Looking back on the first 5 week's prompts, choose the one that resonated with you most. Pick two other students in class and read their options and their choices. In this week's essay, summarize each of those responses with a simple bullet list in your own file and then pretend THEIR CHOICES are the only choices you have (don't go back and revisit your essay for the prompt). Given their choices only, which would YOU choose? Do you agree with the authors? Explain why or why not.

# Selected Question: Week 3

While maintaining an extremely popular Open-Source project, authorities contact you asking that you introduce back door code to allow them to gather the needed evidence to stop an online child trafficking scheme. What are three responses? What do you do?

> Note: an open-source maintainer is a volunteer who owns a repository others contribute to. The repository, if popular, will be used in many software programs either as reference or as a library. A company does not own an open-source project.

# Person 1: Gabe
### Option 1: Refuse to Build the Backdoor for the Authorities
- Integrity is most important; you do not want to break anyone's trust by opening a back door.
- Maintains user privacy, but authorities could suspect you as being suspicious or take further actions
### Option 2: Bring in the Backdoor but with Full Transparency
- Transparency is the best model; despite a possible loss of trust, everyone using this software should know about this significant risk.
- Creates the back door, but no trust is broken since you ensure your users know the dangers.
- Despite complying, it still could cause issues.
### Option 3: Comply Fully with the Authorities
- Based on the principle of showing compassion for the vulnerable and possibly saving the lives of many children.
- The right thing to do is assist in combatting such a heinous operation.
- The possible loss of trust and security concerns are worth the risk of helping those who cannot fight for themselves.
### Gabe's Selected Choice: Option 3
- The weight of saving the vulnerable and oppressed outweighs needing another paycheck.
- The Bible says to submit to governing authorities

# Person 2: Brady
### Option 1: Comply with Authorities for the Greater Good
- The Bible says to comply with the authorities, and they are fighting for a good cause, so you should give their support.
- Assist in stopping evildoers despite the risk of hurting user trust.
### Option 2: Deny Authorities and Commit to the Security of Open Source Code and Users
- The government is overstepping boundaries by forcing you to harm the trust of your users.
- Protects those not involved with this case, especially from government spying.
- However, this slows the progress of catching the wrongdoers, and people could be trafficked longer because of YOU.
### Option 3: Comply With Authorities but Make Them Agree to Certain Conditions
- Provides the best of both sides
    - Allowing justice against the human traffickers.
    - Maintain user security with the conditions.
- However, the authorities may disagree or break the terms anyway.
### Brady's Selected Choice: Option 3
- The best balance of benefits from the previous two options, providing both justice and security.
- It is better to propose options and have them not accepted than make no effort.

# My Choice:
Between Gabe and Brady's final choices, I would choose Brady's.
This decision comes from my agreement with his final sentiment, "While it is not guaranteed that the users privacy will be safe and that the authorities will hold good on their promise, it is better to propose the option and fail, then to not propose it at all while still saving the trafficking victims."
Opening a backdoor and doing nothing else is a tremendous risk to your reputation and the trust of your users. In addition, your code is open source, meaning someone will probably find it, causing most of your reputation to go down the drain. Whether or not the authorities will agree to or keep your conditions is a separate story, but it is better to try and fail than do nothing.
### Reflection
I picked this question because it was the question I struggled with the most. Coming up with a middle ground or an alternative in this dilemma was not easy. Brady's middle ground is the best, especially since the idea of a "transparent back door" was foolish (sorry Gabe).
In addition, I agree with Brady's choice since I remember coming up with a similar option. It shows that you tried to protect the users while limiting the power of the authorities and the blame you could receive if something went wrong.
However, the conditions Brady brought forward in his script were VERY broad and didn't make much sense. The whole purpose of the back door IS to spy on people to collect evidence, and making the back door "only accessible to them" is not a condition. I hope that would be a given. I would have set conditions for the type of data collected or how the data would be used. In addition, I would have had some agreement if these terms were broken, a plan if the backdoor was ever abused, and an outline of who the blame gets placed on if the backdoor gets discovered.
