# Ethics Assignment Week 05
#### Brady Pacheco

## Question
You are a Computer Science professor at a local university teaching C Sharp to some very smart business students. In the second week of class, you spend an entire lecture with your students exhaustively talking about software plagiarism and copyright law with a Christian intellectual property attorney who makes it truly clear that taking code from another developer or site then calling it your own is not only legally wrong but morally wrong. In addition, your institution publishes the following policy:

>Plagiarism includes using someone else's data file as your own or representing the work of others as your own.

>The penalty for violating the academic integrity code is severe. Any student violating the academic integrity code may receive a failing grade for the course and will be reported. If a student is unclear about whether a particular situation may constitute an academic integrity violation, the student should meet with the instructor to discuss the situation.

>For this class, it is permissible to assist classmates in general discussions and such general advice and interaction is encouraged. Each person, however, must develop his or her own solutions to the assigned projects, assignments, and tasks. In other words, students may not "work together" on graded assignments unless specifically assigned to a group task by the course instructor. Such unauthorized collaboration would constitute cheating. A student may not use or copy (by any means) another's work (or portions of it) and represent it as his or her own.

**Then this**

Just a week or two into class, one of your students submits an assignment that is very good. Too good? You check and discover the code is identical to a C# tutorial on the internet. It is clear the student copied the code. The writing is on the wall. But remember, you love this student: you don't want to overreact. But you love your other students too: you want to be fair. You are also a new professor at this university: you don't want to underreact. A lot to think about. What do you do?


## Answer

### Option 1: Extend Deadline; Give Second Chance
#### 1. Pros

* Student gets to keep their grade
* Student learns while receieving minimal punishment
* Student may be tempted to cheat again or find a workaround

#### 2. Cons

* Event goes unreported
* Consequences are not be as severe as inteneded
* Undermines established rules regarding acedemic integrity

#### 3. Script

**Me:** "Hey Student, I noticed that the code you submitted in your last assignment was identicle to an online tutorial. I have to tell you that this is plagarism and unacceptable."

**Student:** "Yes you're right. I used that tutorial and copied it line for line. I am sorry."

**Me:** "I understand the incentive to use tutorials but you cannot copy them line for line. The consequences for plagarism are severe and I don't want to have to do that to you. For that reason I will extend the deadline *for you only* for 3 days and you will need to submit the assignment again. You need to write the assignment completely on your own. If I catch you plagarisizing anything else at all you will fail this class and be reported."

#### 4. Scripture

> **Ephesians 4:32** <br> Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you.

#### 5. First Principle
Even when others mess up, we should many times, first and foremost, attempt to forgive. Forgiveness can go a long way and simply pointing out that I see the student's blatant mistake and yet forgive him could be what he needs.

### Option 2: Schedule a Meeting With the Dean
#### 1. Pros

* An in-person meeting could help reduce consequences
* Student gets to face harsh reality of plagarism
* Dean and authority is notified properly

#### 2. Cons

* Consequences may be more severe than intended
* Could take too long to get results
* May refelect poorly on me as if I don't want to follow rules

#### 3. Script

**Me:** "Hey Student, I noticed that the code you submitted in your last assignment was identicle to an online tutorial. I have to tell you that this is plagarism and unacceptable. Because of this We will schduel a meeting with the Dean to discuss how to proceed."

**Student:** "I'm sorry that I did that. We will see that the Dean says."

Later at the Meeting...
***

**Me:** "Hello Dean, My student was caught plagarzing a coding assignemnt from an online tutorial. I understand the consequences for plagarism are severe and should not be taken lightly. However, this student is usually a rockstar in class and has the potential to go very far."

**Dean:** "I understand. Because I must enforce some sort of punishment for plagarism, I will have your professor fail you on this assignement. Because you have proven yourself to be a good student and this is a one-time occurence, that is the only punishment you will face this time. However, if it happens again you will fail the class and we will have a follow-up meeting about your attendance at our school."

**Student:** "Thank you for your grace and mercy. It will not happen again and I have learned my lesson."

#### 4. Scripture

> **Matthew 18:15-17** <br> If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother. 16 But if he does not listen, take one or two others along with you, that every charge may be established by the evidence of two or three witnesses. 17 If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church. And if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector.

#### 5. First Principle
While this verse talks about sin issues in the *church*, and also tells to talk with the person directly first, it still speaks on the improtance of involving authority and the benfits of such. Authority is important and it is important to bring things to light. By escalating who knows about the situation the student will likely be more prone to listen and take things more sersiously.

### Option 3: Give Student a 0 + a Paper
#### 1. Pros

* Student recieves some due punishment
* Student must articualte theier mistake
* Grace is given to a student who is otherwise good

#### 2. Cons

* Consequences may not be as severe as intended
* Not reporting the incident may undermine authority
* Bending the rules can be a slippery slope

#### 3. Script

**Me:** "Hey Student, I noticed that the code you submitted in your last assignment was identicle to an online tutorial. I have to tell you that this is plagarism and unacceptable."

**Student:** "You are right. I copied a tutorial line for line and used it as my own. I am sorry."

**Me:** "I understand the temptation to use a tutorial but you cannot copy it line for line. For this reason, I will have to give you a 0 for this assignemnt as it it not your work. Also, I need a 5 page paper by the end of next week on why this was wrong and what you learned. I will also be informing the Dean about this so if it happens in any other classes they will be linked."

#### 4. Scripture

> **Proverbs 17:10** <br> A rebuke goes deeper into a man of understanding than a hundred blows into a fool.

#### 5. First Principle
Sometimes the harsh reality of a situation needs to be given yet with still a little bit of grace. The student plagarized and deserves punishment. A rebuke to someone can kick them back into gear and encourage them to be who they know they can be.

## Excursus

The dilemma here is that a usually solid and lovable student has done something whihch is inexcusable and calls for severe punishment.

This is an issue because as Christians, we are called to do several things: give grace and forgiveness, listen to authority and written rules we are under, and to rebuke those who need to be rebuked. Trying to do all of these things together can not alwasy be done, as in this situation, and so the situation must be analyzed as to what would best serve the student, the authority, and me as the teacher. 

## My Choice

I would choose option 2 although I am also very tempted by option 3. I think option 2 does the best job at balancing the best interests of all parties involved (or who should be involved). Option 2 will very likely rebuke and scare the student into doing better, while also showing my character to the Dean that I will report students who need to be reported and follow proper rules. The only thing which could be scary about option 2 is that the Dean could very easily enact consequences on the student which I never intended and that could be extremely severe. Option 2 also would hopefully allow for me to vouch for the loveable and usually solid student and to try and get less severe punsihments for him. In the end, option 2 takes the situation to the proper authorrty and allows for rebuking of bad decisions while also still allowing plenty of room for grace and mercy.
