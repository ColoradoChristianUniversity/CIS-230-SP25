## Question
While working on a project under intense budget and time pressures, a key teammate shares with you in confidence that he is suffering from debilitating depression. If this project fails, your company will lose their largest customer. What are three responses? What do you do?

## Answer

### Option 1: Talk with co-worker more; Walk with him through it.
#### 1. Pros

* Develop trusting relationship between you and your co-worker
* Takes priority of human life over the project
* Creates space for him to deal with what he needs to deal with.

#### 2. Cons

* Project could suffer.
* Co-worker could get defensive and shut down more.
* His safety is not guaranteed; nobody else knows.

#### 3. Script

**Me:** "I'm really sorry you have to go through that. I would love to talk about it and hear about your situation more."

**Co-Worker:** "Thanks. I've just been extremely overwhelmed with this project and other factors in my life."

**Me:** "I totally understand. What do you need from me to help you out?"

#### 4. Scripture

> **Ephesians 4:32** <br> Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you

#### 5. First Principle
As Christians, we should always be gentle and compassionate towards others. We should recognize that everyone has their own struggles and story. We are called to be lights unto others.

### Option 2: Ensure safety; Alert management.
#### 1. Pros

* His safety is more assured.
* Evaluates mental status and could lead to professional help.
* Prevents co-worker from endangering himself or others.

#### 2. Cons

* Break his trust by telling others.
* Could take focus off the project.
* Management could fire co-worker.

#### 3. Script

**Me:** "Hello Manager, my co-worker has opened up that he is struggling with depression and I just wanted to let you know."

**Manager:** "Thanks for letting me know. I will keep an eye on him and maybe talk to him soon."

**Me:** "Thanks, I hope he can pull through."

#### 4. Scripture

> **Philippians 2:3–4** <br> Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves. Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others.

#### 5. First Principle
Even though he abided in confidence, there are some situations which call for alerting others and bringing others in. This is to his benefit and to the benefit of those whose safety could be endangered. 

***

### Option 3: Take on some of his work; Try and lighten his burden.
#### 1. Pros

* He has less to do and hopefully less stress.
* Could promote further progress on the project.
* Could build friendship and more trust.

#### 2. Cons

* I have more work to do.
* Could inadvertently give me more stress and anxiety.
* Could end up decreasing project efficiency or quality.

#### 3. Script

**Me:** "I’m so sorry you have to go through that. I would love to help you out by taking some of your work."

**Co-worker:** "Thank you that really means a lot. That should help me get thought this."

**Me:** "You're welcome. Let me know if you need anything else."

#### 4. Scripture

> **Galatians 6:1-2** <br> Brothers, if anyone is caught in any transgression, you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness. Keep watch on yourself, lest you too be tempted. Bear one another’s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.

#### 5. First Principle
As Christians, we are called to help others when we can and help carry thier burdens when we can. This can be a light of hope in his seemingly devoid of hope life and could lead to him encountering God.

## Excursus

The dilemma here is that a co-worker who abided in confidence is potentially at risk of self-harm while also being a pivotal piece to a large and important project. The co-worker abided these things in confidence and asked for them not be shared, however, it would be to everyone's benefit for these things to be known.

This is an issue because as Christians, we should honors others requests and try to help them through things as best we can. We also have obligations to our job and work to do them to the best of our ability and to obey management.

## My Choice

I would choose option 1 and do parts of option 3 if necessary. There is no case where the project is more important than the wellbeing and life of the co-worker. If the project suffers, if the company loses its biggest client, it does not matter because we are dealing with human life. If my co-worker is alive than all is well, and God will take care of me. I would walk with him and attempt to slowly and gently disciple him while also giving him some options for me to help him in his work.
