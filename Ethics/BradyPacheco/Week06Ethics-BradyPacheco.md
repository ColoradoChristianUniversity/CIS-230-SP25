# Ethics Assignment Week 04
#### Brady Pacheco

## Question
This week is different

ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è The root of this site has the ethics write-up of everyone in class. You can go there, and you can browse and read anyone's essays. Looking back on the first 5 week's prompts, choose the one that resonated with you most. Pick two other students in class and read their options and their choices. In this week's essay, summarize each of those responses with a simple bullet list in your own file and then pretend THEIR CHOICES are the only choices you have (don't go back and revisit your essay for the prompt). Given their choices only, which would YOU choose? Do you agree with the authors? Explain why or why not.

## My Analysis

Between JD and Levi there are several good options which I did not consider. I really like JD's option of letting the student come forward on their own and being patient through the whole process. I think this raises an interesting question of whether or not you should give students time to come forward as that might even teach them more. However, the longer you wait the more incentivized they might be to do it again and consequentially be in more trouble than they were to begin with. However, this would also allow me, as a teacher, to see whether they did this as a one-time occurrence or if it is a deeper character problem and when they go uncaught, continue to partake in the misguided behavior. <br>

Levi's option 2 is also interesting. In Levi's option 2 he gives the student an opportunity to demonstrate whether or not they understand what they copied and then adjust the consequences accordingly. This is intriguing as it is able to punish the student based on how egregious their plagiarism behavior is. If the plagiarism was done without understanding at all what the code means, the student should be punished more than if they made an honest attempt to understand the code along with the tutorial. <br>

In an ideal world I would combine these two options to form a great learning experience for the student that is also just and follows the rules. I think it would be great to give the student time to come forward, and whether they do or not, in the eventual conversation about their plagiarism give them opportunity to show they at least somewhat tried. However, if I had to choose an option from these two without combining any, I would choose JD's option 2. It is a really intriguing option for me, and I think it could serve the student really well, especially if you explain to them that you caught them cheating some time ago and were waiting to see what they would do. I think this would help establish the lesson that needs to be learned and will make the student more paranoid and cautious about cheating in the future as well as embedding in their mind the option that they can always come forward to do the right thing. All around a great option and one I did not think of.
