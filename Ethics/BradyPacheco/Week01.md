## Question

While working as an engineer at a Credit Card company, you are tasked to resolve problems experienced by your employerâ€™s second largest customer: a well-known pornography web site. Resolving their problems will not only reduce their frustration but should make them considerably more efficient and profitable. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

## Answer

### Option 1: Express Discomfort on Project, Ask to be Moved
#### 1. Pros

* Open and clear about beliefs
* Avoid crossing personal boundaries
* May inspire others to join

#### 2. Cons

* Could look not committed to the job
* May lose work or future work; could be demoted
* You might seem inflexible and there may be no other projects to move to

#### 3. Script

**Me:** "Hey, I need to let you know that working on this project really strains my personal beliefs and morals. Would there be any way I could move to a different project?"

**Manager:** "Oh I had no idea! I'm sure there is another project you could lead and move to."

**Me:** "Thank you. I appreciate your flexibility."
#### 4. Scripture

> **2 Corinthians 3:12** <br> Since we have such a hope, we are very bold, 

#### 5. First Principle
We should stand up for what we believe. Even when it may seem awkward or costly, it is our duty to protect our moral conscience and duty to God. It may even inspire others to do the same.

### Option 2: Ask to do menial tasks and busy work
#### 1. Pros

* Mostly avoid crossing personal moral boundaries
* Can still contribute to the team
* Boss can see that even in uncomfortable moral situations you care about the company and want to work
* Could use the opportunity to evangelize to coworkers who are on the project

#### 2. Cons

* Easier work could come with less pay
* May set bad expectations for future projects
* Could look bad to other coworkers who have to do more work now

#### 3. Script

**Me:** "Hey, I need to tell you that working on this project is uncomfortable for me and crosses some of my moral boundaries. Would it be possible for me to still work on the project but just do some side tasks and busy work instead of leading the team and the engineering?"

**Manager:** "Thanks for letting me know. I'll see how I can divide the work so that you can take a back seat and I'll see if someone else can step up to lead the project."

**Me:** "Thank you. I will make sure that the work I do is still my 100%"

#### 4. Scripture

> **Hebrews 4:12**
<br> For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and of spirit, of joints and of marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart.

#### 5. First Principle
God knows our heart. While it is not ideal to be on the project, God knows if we didn't have to we wouldn't in most situations. We can trust him and know that he understands our situation.

### Option 3: Realize the autonomy of the comapny and do the work
#### 1. Pros

* No one is upset and the work gets done
* Job remains stable and you continue to lead projects
* No bad precedent is set things go normally

#### 2. Cons

* You have to help a company you believe participates in a net harm to society
* May have the feeling of compromising moral beliefs for the sake of your job / guilt
* Could be asked indefinitely to help the pornography site and they could be a client for many years with returning work
* Could be an even better opportunity to evangelize than the previous scenario since you are now leading the project

#### 3. Script

**Me:** "Hey, I just wanted to let you know that I'm uncomfortable with this assignment but I realize it's my job so I will do the work anyways."

**Manager:** "Thanks for letting me know, I'll try to make sure we respect your boundaries during this project."

**Me:** "Thank you, I'll make sure I still do my best work and contribute in meaningful ways."

#### 4. Scripture

> **John 16:33**
<br> I have said these things to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation. But take heart; I have overcome the world.

#### 5. First Principle
God is sovereign. We cannot be the savior of the world nor can we control our surroundings. Ultimately God is in control and sometimes we must do things even when they are not ideal. He has overcome the world and my hope is in Him.

## Excursus

The dilemma here is that I, a believing and practicing Christian, am tasked with aiding a porn website in their business dealings. While I am not asked to directly contribute to *content* or *explicit material*, I am tasked with helping their site's functionality. In improving the site's functionality I am directly contributing to the sites usefulness in its intentions and its usability for users. I am also making the company more profitable and thus could even be *growing* the business. 

This is an issue because as Christians, we are called to avoid all sorts of adultery, fornication, lust, sexual temptation, and sexual sin. All of which are the site's main purpose: To help people experience sexual fantasies and to be sexually active in them. 

## My Choice

My first choice would be option 1, however option 3 is not far behind, even though they are on opposite ends of the answer spectrum. I would chose option 1 since it seems like the most approachable and respectful way to avoid helping such a company and to also keep my job. However, sometimes the right thing to do is to understand the job at hand and God's sovereignty over all and to give it to him. I think it is hard to go wrong in either situation but option 1 for me beats out option 3. Not only does option 1 set a precedent for myself but also for others and the company. If it becomes a regular area of complaint and strain, perhaps the company moves on. It can also show coworkers the power of faith and standing for what you believe in. If however there are no other projects to be moved to, I think handing it to God and getting the job done is still commendable, even though hard.
