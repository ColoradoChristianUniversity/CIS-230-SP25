### Option 2: Ask to do menial tasks and busy work
#### 1. Pros

**Me:** "Thank you. I will make sure that the work I do is still my 100%"

<br> For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and of spirit, of joints and of marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart.

God knows our heart. While it is not ideal to be on the project, God knows if we didn't have to we wouldn't in most situations. We can trust him and know that he understands our situation.

#### 3. Script

God is sovereign. We cannot be the savior of the world nor can we control our surroundings. Ultimately God is in control and sometimes we must do things even when they are not ideal. He has overcome the world and my hope is in Him.

## Excursus

The dilema here is that I, a beleiving and practicing Christian, am tasked with aiding a porn website in their business dealings. While I am not asked to directly contribute to *content* or *excplicit material*, I am tasked with helping thier site's functionality. In improving the site's functionalty I am directly contributing to the sites usefulness in its intentions and its usablity for users. I am also making the company more profitable and thus could even be *growing* the business. 

This is an issue because as Christians, we are called to avoid all sorts of adultry, fornication, lust, sexual tempation, and sexual sin. All of which are the site's main purpose: To help people expereince sexual fantasies and to be sexually active in them. 

## My Choice

My first choice would be option 1, however option 3 is not far behind, even though they are on opposite ends of the answer spectrum. I would chose option 1 since it seems like the most appraochable and respectful way to avoid helping sucha a company and to also keep my job. However, sometimes the right thing to do is to understand the job at hand and God's sovereignty over all and to give it to him. I think it is hard to go wrong in either situation but option 1 for me beats out option 3. Not only does option 1 set a precendent for myself but also for others and the company. If it becomes a regular area of complaint and strain, perhaps the company moves on. It can also show coworkers the power of faith and standing for what you belive in. If however there are no other porjects to be moved to, I think handing it to God and getting the job done is still commendable, even though hard.
