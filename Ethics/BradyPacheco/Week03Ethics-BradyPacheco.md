## Question

While maintaining an extremely popular Open-Source project, authorities contact you asking that you introduce back door code to allow them to gather the needed evidence to stop an online child trafficking scheme. What are three responses? What do you do?

> Note: an open-source maintainer is a volunteer who owns a repository others contribute to. The repository, if popular, will be used in many software programs either as reference or as a library. A company does not own an open-source project.

## Answer

### Option 1: Comply with Authorities for the Greater Good
#### 1. Pros

* Likely to save human trafficking victims
* Could expose many criminals and wrong-doers
* Could have a cleaner consious than saying no

#### 2. Cons

* Could comprimise user programs
* Could hurt trust of users
* Potential to do more harm than good

#### 3. Script

**Me:** "Hello Authorities, I understand the need for this backdoor. While it may hurt some users, the objective of saving human trafficking victims is of greater improtance."

**Authorities:** "Thank you, we will be using this backdoor right away."

**Me:** "You're Welcome."

#### 4. Scripture

> **Romans 13:2** <br> Therefore whoever resists the authorities resists what God has appointed, and those who resist will incur judgment.

#### 5. First Principle
God has established governments and uses them for good. When we resist the government, especially in there striving to bring justice to evils, we can be inhibiting God's plan to enact justice. Even when we don't understand the fallout or consequences.

### Option 2: Deny Authorties and Commit to the Secuity of Open Source Code and Users
#### 1. Pros

* Gain trust and respect from users
* Ensure the security of users
* Save users from unecessary government spying

#### 2. Cons

* Human trafficking victims will likely continue to be trafficked for longer
* Impeading the governments attempt to enact justice
* Could be governmental government consequences

#### 3. Script

**Me:** "I understand your request and its goals, however, the security and privacy of the open source users is  more important."

**Authorities:** "We are extremely close to cathing these criminals and this could stop them for good."

**Me:** "I understand, however, if I build in this backdoor, not only could you use it to spy on other people outside of those whom are involved in the trafficking scheme, but it would make thousands of projects which use the opensource code vulnerable and anyone could find and use this backdoor."


#### 4. Scripture

> **Matthew 21:12-13** <br> And Jesus entered the temple and drove out all who sold and bought in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those who sold pigeons. He said to them, “It is written, ‘My house shall be called a house of prayer,’ but you make it a den of robbers.”

#### 5. First Principle
While we should submit to the governemnt in most cases, sometimes the government and established institutions overstep thier boundaries and use what they have for evil. The potential negative consequences of this decision could be immense.

### Option 3: Comply With Authorites but Make Them Agree to Certain Conditions
#### 1. Pros

* Could both save human trafficking victims
* Could protect privacy and secuirty of users
* Could set a positive precedent and help everyone

#### 2. Cons

* Authorities may not comply to conditions
* Authorities may say they will comply but are not garunteed to
* Users could still be negatively affected

#### 3. Script

**Me:** "I understand your request for a backdoor in order to capture human-traffickers, however, doing this could expose users of the open source code to secuirty and vulnerability issues. For these reasons, I want to comply but there will be conditions."

**Authorities:** "We will see what we can do. What are your conditions?"

**Me:** "I will work with your people in order to make this backdoor *only* accessible by you. Also, you must only use this backdoor for the purpose of evidence towards the human trafficking scheme, nothing else. No spying on other users or using the data collected for other purposes."

**Authorities:** "We will confer and let you know shortly our decision."

#### 4. Scripture

> **Romans 15:1-2** <br> We who are strong have an obligation to bear with the failings of the weak, and not to please ourselves. Let each of us please his neighbor for his good, to build him up

> **Mark 12:17** <br> Jesus said to them, “Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.” And they marveled at him. 

#### 5. First Principle
Both of these verses combined remind us that we are to give the government what we owe them however we are to always advocate for the weak and those we can help. This option, if successful, grants secuirty to users and also renders to the government what they want. 

## Excursus

The dilemma here is that the authorities are asking for permissions which I can give in order to stop an egregious and moral evil. However, the permissions I grant them, could result in cascading problems for many others and grant authorities too much power and unrestricted permissions.

This is an issue because as Christians, we should always strive to protect those who cannot protect themselves. In giving the auhtorites a back door, you are protecting trafficking victims who cannot protect themselves. However, you may be exposing others the threates and vulnerablities unknowingly and making it so *they* cannot protect themselves.

## My Choice

I would choose option
