## Question

While maintaining an extremely popular Open-Source project, authorities contact you asking that you introduce back door code to allow them to gather the needed evidence to stop an online child trafficking scheme. What are three responses? What do you do?

> Note: an open-source maintainer is a volunteer who owns a repository others contribute to. The repository, if popular, will be used in many software programs either as reference or as a library. A company does not own an open-source project.

## Answer

#### 3. Script

**Me:** "Hello Authorities, I understand the need for this backdoor. While it may hurt some users, the objective of saving human trafficking victims is of greater improtance."

**Authorities:** "Thank you, we will be using this backdoor right away."

**Me:** "You're Welcome"

#### 4. Scripture

> **Romans 13:2** <br> Therefore whoever resists the authorities resists what God has appointed, and those who resist will incur judgment.

#### 5. First Principle
God has established governments and uses them for good. When we resist the government, especially in there striving to bring justice to evils, we can be inhibiting God's plan to enact justice. Even when we don't understand the fallout or consequences.

## Excursus

The dilemma here is that the authorities are asking for permissions which I can give in order to stop an egregious and moral evil. However, the permissions I grant them, could result in cascading problems for many others and grant authorities too much power and unrestricted permissions.

This is an issue because as Christians, we should always strive to protect those who cannot protect themselves. In giving the auhtorites a back door, you are protecting trafficking victims who cannot protect themselves. However, you may be exposing others the threates and vulnerablities unknowingly and making it so *they* cannot protect themselves.
