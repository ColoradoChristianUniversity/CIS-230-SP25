## Question
A junior engineer at your company, leveraging advanced Artificial Intelligence, has completed a critical software project well ahead of schedule. The AI has written almost the entire application, raising questions about the engineer's understanding of the project's intricacies. Despite this, the company's management, impressed by the speedy delivery, is planning to integrate this AI-generated software into major systems immediately. You are concerned but you are also friends with this junior developer. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

## Answer

### Option 1: Set up a Meeting with Junior Engineer and Management
#### 1. Pros

* Everybody is informed about the dangers
* Everybody is on the same page about what happened and should happen
* The Junior Engineer gets greater recognition

#### 2. Cons

* Junior Engineer may be unprepared and risk his job
* An unready or dangerous software could still end up getting integrated
* Management may not have time to meet properly or meet at all

#### 3. Script

**Me:** "Hey Manager, Junior Engineer's code he recently devoloped was written by AI in many portions. Because we are planning to implement this at a large scale, I was wondering if we could set up a meeting along with Junior Developer in order to make sure things are are tight."

**Manager:** "Yeah that is a great idea. Lets set this up for next week."

**Me:** "Perfect, thank you. I will let Junior Developer know."

#### 4. Scripture

> **Colossians 3:23-25** <br> Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men, knowing that from the Lord you will receive the inheritance as your reward. You are serving the Lord Christ. For the wrongdoer will be paid back for the wrong he has done, and there is no partiality.

#### 5. First Principle
As Christians, we are called to maintain that the work we do is of high quality and satisfies those who we are doing it for. Beacuse, we are held to this high standard of work, we should make sure that we look out for our company and make sure things run smoothly, especially when we have important knowledge that could damage things if we don't speak up.

### Option 2: Sit Down with Junior Engineer and go Over the Code
#### 1. Pros

* Code is quality-ensured
* Issue stays between Junior Engineer and I
* Issues could be resolved quickly

#### 2. Cons

* Junior engineer may be disinterested in the quality
* Management may found out anyway and be displeased at the lack of communication
* Many code-based issues may arise and delay project as well as create conflict and distrust

#### 3. Script

**Me:** "Hey Junior Engineer, I know that much of your recent code was done with AI. I was hoping we could set up a meeting for next week where we run over the code to make sure everything is the way it should be."

**Junior Engineer:** "Sure, that sounds great. I have already looked it over quite a bit but this may be good at providing another perspective."

**Me:** "Awesome, I will see you then."

#### 4. Scripture

> **Colossians 3:13-14** <br> Bearing with one another and, if one has a complaint against another, forgiving each other; as the Lord has forgiven you, so you also must forgive. 14 And above all these put on love, which binds everything together in perfect harmony

#### 5. First Principle
As Christians, we should seek to make peace and resovle issues appropriately and quietly (when applicable). In this option of the scenario, it is good to work out the bugs and potnetial issues one on one with the coworker and then to go from there.

### Option 3: Get a Team Together to Look Over the Code and Make Sure it has Proper Implementation
#### 1. Pros

* A larger set of eyes looking at the code
* Better expreienced devs looking at the code
* Could set precedent to accelerate progress in the future (By writing more code like this in the future).

#### 2. Cons

* Potential for Junior Engineer to feel insulted
* Potential for "too many cooks in the kitchen"
* Management may not approve and the meeting may take too long

#### 3. Script

**Me:** "Hello everyone, there has been some recent code written where large sections were done by AI. Management is impressed by the speed at which this code was delivered but is unaware of the potential dangers of using AI code. For this reason, we should set up a meeting to go over all the code and make sure its good."

**Team:** "We are willing but this seems like it may be out of our realm and or not our job."

**Me:** "I understand. However, if this goes well, this could lead to the implementation of more AI by the rest of us saving us some time. Furhter, since we all are working on this project, the failure of one becomes the failure of us all."

#### 4. Scripture

> **Ecclesiastes 4:9-10** <br> Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their toil. For if they fall, one will lift up his fellow. But woe to him who is alone when he falls and has not another to lift him up.

#### 5. First Principle
It is important to ask for help and to make sure others have the help they need. Letting this code go by unseen and into the world without a second glance would be extremely irresponsible and could be the downfall of so many different parts. For this reason, it it improtant to ask for help and to get the input of others. 

## Excursus

The dilemma here is that a Junior Engineer in the company created code for a project in which large sections of the code were written by AI. This is a probelm for several reasons. First of all, the code, written by AI and largely unchecked, could be dangerous or introduce many unwanted problems. However, the engineer is a close friend of mine and so it is improtant to deal sensitvely with the issues. Lastly, because of the code's quick turn around thanks to AI, management wants the code integrated quickly and with less thought. All of these things are improtant to weigh when considering what to do with the friend junior engineer and how to make sure the code can do what it needs to do the right way. 

## My Choice

I would choose option 1. Option 1 allows for the most flexibility and outcomes. By letting management know about the potential issues, the Junior Engineer isn't 'thrown under the bus' and is instead invited into the meeting and the problem solving. It allows both me and the Junior Engineer to engage in meaningful conversation and warning with management. However, this option could definietly lead to risking the safety of the Junior Engineer's job. Because he submitted the potentially dangerous code in the first place, management may be hard on him or not appreciate the warning. However, the company is likely either too big to make this sort of risk or too small/vulnerable to make this risk. Either way, the company cannot afford to take this risk and the code needs to be checked. If I have important knowledge that could save the company from a large calamity it is my duty to make sure that the code is properly written and integrated. I will, however, try to approach the situation with as much grace, patience, humilty, and gentleness as possible. Option 1 allows everybody to be involved and accountable while getting the code where it needs to be.
