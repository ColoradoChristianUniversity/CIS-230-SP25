## Question
A junior engineer at your company, leveraging advanced Artificial Intelligence, has completed a critical software project well ahead of schedule. The AI has written almost the entire application, raising questions about the engineer's understanding of the project's intricacies. Despite this, the company's management, impressed by the speedy delivery, is planning to integrate this AI-generated software into major systems immediately. You are concerned but you are also friends with this junior developer. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

#### 5. First Principle
As Christians, we are called to maintain that the work we do is of high quality and satisfies those who we are doing it for. Beacuse, we are held to this high standard of work, we should make sure that we look out for our company and make sure things run smoothly, especially when we have important knowledge that could damage things if we don't speak up.
