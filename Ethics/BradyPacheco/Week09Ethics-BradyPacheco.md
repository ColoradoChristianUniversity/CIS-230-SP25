## Question
While working on an engineering team, you mentor a teammate for 6 months to no avail, he is just not catching on. You learn he is up for a raise as company leadership has mistakenly given him sole credit for work you have done together. What are three possible responses? What do you do?


## Answer

### Option 1: Ask Teammate to Advocate for You
#### 1. Pros

* I could get the raise I desire
* Teammate gets to be honest
* Teammate is not "thrown to the wolves" in a higher paid postion he is unready for

#### 2. Cons

* Teammate could likely lose raise
* Could damage relationship with teammate
* Management may not listen

#### 3. Script

**Me:** "Hey teammate, I know you are being considered right now for a raise. I think thats really awesome but I have to be honest, most of what they are attributing to you was done by me. When you speak to them do you think you could mention me and everything I have done?"

**Teammate:** "You're right, you have been mentoring me and put a lot more into this project than I have. I will be sure to talk about everything you've done on this project and see if they are interesed in talking to you."

**Me:** "Thank you!"

#### 4. Scripture

> **Proverbs 31:8-9** <br> Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves, for the rights of all who are destitute. Speak up and judge fairly; defend the rights of the poor and needy.

#### 5. First Principle
In many cases it is important to stand up for what is right and the Bible reminds us to so. In this case, it is me asking another to stand up for what is right and make the right and fait decision.

### Option 2: Make Case to Manager and Explain Situation
#### 1. Pros

* More likely to be heard for what I offer
* Could be seen as courageous
* Puts more control in my hands

#### 2. Cons

* Could hurt relationship with teammate
* Could be seen as desperate or begging
* Could be seen as lying

#### 3. Script

**Me:** "Hi management, I understand you are considering my teammate for a raise. While he has great work ethic is always present, I have to be honest that most of what you admire about his work is things I have done for him and have helped him with significantly."

**Management:** "Ah, we see. We were unaware of how influential and important you were in the completion of his work. We will have to take another look at what to do and perhaps consider you instead."

**Me:** "Thank you for hearing me out and my perspective."

#### 4. Scripture

> **2 Timothy 1:7** <br> for God gave us a spirit not of fear but of power and love and self-control.

#### 5. First Principle
Sometimes, we have to approach situations with a confidence and zeal in our own ability and know-how. In a sitation like this, where the teammate could be hurt by getting this promotion, I should stand up for whats right and advocate for myself when necessary.

**Me:** "Hey teammate, I heard you are being considered for a raise. Thats really great! I think you should pursue it and go for it."

**Teammate:** "Really? I know a lot of what they are impressed by are things you've done. But if you think so I will, my family could really benefit from the raise."

**Me:** "Yes I think you should gor for it. Your family can benefit from the raise which is awesome. What I will ask however is that you advoacte for me and my ability once you receive your raise and mayve advocate I get one too? "

**Teammate:** "Of course! I would be happy to."

#### 4. Scripture

> **1 Peter 2:18** <br> Servants, be subject to your masters with all respect, not only to the good and gentle but also to the unjust.

#### 5. First Principle
Sometimes the powers above us make decisions which are unfair or even incorrect. As Christians, we can submit to these decisions while still trying to advocate for ourselves.

## Excursus

The dilemma here is that a teammate of mine is up for a raise at the company but is only up for the raise beacuse he has mistakenly been given credit for things I have done. This teammate is also not great at what he does and does not learn things quickly. 

This is an issue because while I want to adovacte for myeslef, I also need to account for potential relational aspects which could he hurt. It is the question of trying to balance what I feel I deserve while trying to keep everyone else's feelings intact. 

## My Choice

I would choose option 2. This is the most direct and concise option. In my opinion, option 1 gives too much power to someone who may or not use it the way I want them to. By placing the advocate role on my teammates shoulders instead of myself, there is no garuentee he will say what I hope he will or need him to. Option 3 is also not the best because it does not let me advoacte for myself at all and just accepts things as they are. While this can be benefical sometimes, I do not beleive this is one of those situations. Option 2 is the best option because it allows me to say what I want and need to say to everyone I think needs to hear it. This is the best possible way for me to advoacte for myself and get what I desire.
