#### Teammate: "I know, I'm putting in my full effort, but things have been really difficult."
#### Me: "We need you to push through. If you need a break, wait until after the project is done. The whole company is hinging on this right now."
#### Teammate:"Okay, I will still put in my full effort."

## Scripture

#### "Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of many kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance. Let perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything."

## First Principle

#### Me: "I understand, but the company has resources to support you. I'll be here to help however I can, but we should bring in HR to assist with this."

## Scripture 
### Proverbs 15:22
#### "Plans fail for lack of counsel, but with many advisers they succeed."

## First Principle
#### In times of hardship, seeking support is a strength, not a weakness.

## Excursus
#### The ethical dilemma presented in this situation revolves around balancing the needs of the project and the well-being of a teammate. The situation involves a teammate struggling with mental health, which could potentially affect the success and impact of the project. We also need to navigate the potential issue of confidentiality and avoid sharing what shouldn't be shared. The challenge lies in determining what is ethically right for your teammate's well-being while ensuring that the company meets its goals.


## My Choice
#### I would go with Choice #1: Prioritize well-being and seek support. This puts the mental health of the coworker as a priority, focusing on the health of individuals rather than just the success of the company. Mental well-being is important for creating a foundation of long-term productivity and success. Offering support opens up a culture of care and transparency. While it's important to meet company goals, ensuring that everyone is mentally and emotionally supported creates a better work environment.
