**Coworker:** "Yea I noticed that. I am not the one who told them that, so I just assumed that they just put value here."

## Excursus
The ethical dilemma that is being shown in this scenario is balancing your right to be recognized for your role, as a teammate and a mentor, and the work you have done. You have put about six months worth of work into leading someone who hasn't progressed. From a Christian perspective, we are called to uphold truth and fairness but also have grace. It's important to address the mistake made, but also give your coworker a chance to grow in this. 


## My Choice
If I was in the scenario, I would go with Choice 2 - Take it up with your coworker privately. This allows the coworker a chance to take initiative and have integrity about the true amount of work that he has put in. You are also showing him grace in this scenario, you are keeping it private rather than taking it publicly. This is a mentorship moment that pushes your coworker. This is a good Christian stance, this corrects the wrong in a way that is not harsh and fosters growth. Option 1, undermines your contribution and doesn't hold your coworker accountable. And Option 3, risks the trust between you two.
