## Prompt
A junior engineer at your company, leveraging advanced Artificial Intelligence, has completed a critical software project well ahead of schedule. The AI has written almost the entire application, raising questions about the engineer's understanding of the project's intricacies. Despite this, the company's management, impressed by the speedy delivery, is planning to integrate this AI-generated software into major systems immediately. You are concerned but you are also friends with this junior developer. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

### Response #1: Bring it to Management
#### 1. Pros

- Protects the Company.
- Shows you have integrity.
- Sets a precedent to not rely solely on AI.

#### 2. Cons

- Damages trust with the friend.
- Could delay the timeline of the project.

#### 3. Script

**Me:** Hi, about the project. I know others are impressed with the speed of the project, but knowing that AI did most of the work, I think we should double-check the project to make sure everything fits how we want.

**Management:** "Do you think there is an issue?"

**Me:** "I am not sure, but I want to be able to go above the standard rather than aiming to impress by the speed."

**Management** "Okay, we can look over everything to see if it meets our standards."

#### 4. Scripture

*Proverbs 22:3*  
>"The prudent see danger and take refuge, but the simple keep going and pay the penalty."

#### 5. First Principle
"The responsibility that you hold is not just to your friend. It's to your employer and those who are also relying on this project. This ensures that the company is safe and looks out for the collective good."

### Option 2: Keep Quiet and Support the Friend
#### Pros

- Will lead to potential growth in friend's success.
- Preserves the friendship.
- A potential win for AI.

#### Cons

- Potential costs and risks to the company. 
- Could grow reliance on AI without proper oversight

#### Script

**Me:** "Great job on the project man! You finished it crazy fast."

**Friend:** "Thanks! The AI handled most of the project."

**Me:** "Yea man, you're doing great!"

#### Scripture

*1 Thessalonians 5:11* 
>"Therefore encourage one another and build each other up, just as in fact you are doing."

#### 5. First Principle
"Assuming that your friend put a lot of work in with the AI shows confidence in their skills. Questioning them without clear knowledge of bad use could undermine relationships."

### Option 3: Bring it up to Your Friend Privately
#### 1. Pros

- Your acting on your concerns shows integrity.
- Can fix potential risks early before getting to management. 
- Encourages growth.

#### 2. Cons

- Could have little to no impact on the friend.
- Potential strain on friendship. 

#### 3. Script

**Me:** "Hey man, you finished the project really quickly, do you think it hits everything we need?"

**Friend:** "The AI wrote the code, but I went back and fixed some issues. I think it'll hit everything."

**Me:** "Maybe we should look at some of it together to make sure. It could lead to harm to the company and you if it doesn't."

**Friend** "That's a good point, thanks for wanting to help. We should do that now."

#### 4. Scripture

*Galatians 6:1* 
> "Brothers, if anyone is caught in any transgression, you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness."

#### 5. First Principle
"True friendship requires honesty. By privately raising concerns and offering assistance, it shows a lending hand instead of an attack."

## Excursus

The ethical dilemma that presents itself in this scenario is on balancing your friendship with your job for the reliability of the software. From a Christian perspective, we must remember the call to seek truth and extend grace. It's important that there is accountability that is put in place. Giving this to the friend, allows a chance to grow and learn from this issue. Depending on how you respond, this can effect the company, the outcome of the project and your friends life and growth. 

## My Choice

I would choose option 3 for the first time around. I believe that option 1 does not tend to the call of extending grace. Option 2 does not allow for there to be accountability. Even if there is not an issue with this project, if he continues in the future, there could be major issues. Option 3 holds integrity and offers grace. It allows the friend to be able to take the experience and learn from it and make sure that he is not heavily reliant on AI. It brings honesty and shows compassion. It also protects the company as you and your friend look to fix the issues.
