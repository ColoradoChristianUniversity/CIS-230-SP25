## Prompt
You are a software engineer working for a marketing firm that has been hired by a tobacco company to analyze data for a new product. Your team is excited to work on this project because it could save your struggling company during a bad economy. However, you suspect the customer is intending the product for young audiences, but you are not sure. To make matters worse, you have been trying to build a relationship with a coworker who has criticized religion as judgmental; you are worried that taking a moral stand against this product could come across as hypocritical and cause you to lose the opportunity to reach him just as he is softening to spiritual conversations. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

### Response #1: Recommend Adding a Safety Filter for the Data
| Pros                          | Cons                                   |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Aligns with your faith.          | Tobacco company could give pushback.  |
| Could lead to better ethical culture in the workplace.          |   Could be unnecessary.   | 



#### 3. Script

**Me:** "What if we built a filter for the data so that this isn't aimed towards kids? This just keeps us safe."

**Teammate:** "Are you worried about the motivation of their plans?"

**Me:** "It's more so that I just want to be safe. This shows our depth and that we're thinking ahead."

**Teammate:** "It'll be some work but it might be smart to add this."


#### 4. Scripture

*Proverbs 16:21*  
>"The wise in heart are called discerning, and gracious words promote instruction."

#### 5. First Principle
This reflects our commitment as Christians to protect the vulnerable. This is an opportunity to use technology alongside faith.

### Response 2: Have a Ethics conversation with Coworker.


| Pros                          | Cons                                   |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| An opportunity for modeling humble faith.    | May not have any impact on project.   |
| Could encourage coworker to speak up. | Could see it as religious judgment.   | 

#### Script

**Me:** "Hey, I'm a little worried about who exactly is being targeted with this product."

**Coworker:** "Umm, not necessarily, I don't think. How come?"

**Me:** "Would you feel weird if this was aimed at kids?"

**Coworker:** "I hadn't thought about that, but yeah, that would make me feel off. Let's look into it together a little bit more."

#### Scripture

*Colossians 4:6* 
>"Let your conversation be always full of grace, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how to answer to everyone."

#### 5. First Principle
Having these conversations can build trust with your coworker. This can bring open-mindedness and can potentially lead him deeper down the path of wanting to pursue Christ.

### Response 3: Do nothing about it.

| Pros                          | Cons                                   |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Keeps security in relationships and job. | Missed opportunity.      |
| Keeps you focused on the job. | Clashes with your Christian.  | 

#### 3. Script

**Me:** "I'm good to keep working on the project."

**Teammate:** "Are you okay continuing? You seem good with it."

**Me:** "I'm just focused on the project so I can get my paycheck."


#### 4. Scripture

*Ecclesiastes 3:1* 
> "There is a time for everything, and a season for every activity under the heavens."

#### 5. First Principle
This will maintain peace with your job and your coworkers. This protects my ability to potentially have opportunities to share my faith later.

## Excursus
The ethical dilemma here is your role in this project regarding tobacco, against your suspicions of harm to people in their youth. As a Christian, you want to make sure the tension you have is professional but also make sure to still honor God.

## My Choice
Option 1 - Suggest a Safety Filter for the Data would be the choice that addresses my suspicions and my unease about it targeting youth. This avoids seeming judgmental to others, which will seem better to my coworkers. This also keeps me engaged in the project and doesn't cause harm to my job.
