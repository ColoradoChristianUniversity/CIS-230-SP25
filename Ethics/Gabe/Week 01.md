#### Supervisor: "I appreciate your transparency, but this a major client for us. Is there any way that you can work on this without compromising your values?"
#### Me: "I understand the importance. I believe that in order to contribute in the best way, I believe that I should be put on an assignment where my principles and values align with the project. Is there any way reassignment could be an option?"

## Principle
#### It is important to prioritze your faith and values, even in the midst of difficult decisions.

## Excursus
#### The ethical dilemma here is revolving around our job responsibility and our personal beliefs and values. This issue brings forth moral and religious challenges. On one hand, it's our job as the employee to fulfill the responsibilites asked of us. Our supervisor expects quality service that supports the objective and maintains good relationship. On the other hand, personal convictions may lead the employee to feel at risk of betraying their values. This is an issue because as Christians this goes against our values of purity, integrity and honoring God. This can very strongly affect the employees conscience. 


## My Choice
#### I would go with choice 3. I would ask to be reassigned. This ethical issue could bring forth temptation or the wrong people and potentially negatively impact my relationship with the Lord. I understand that weas Christians must work hard and be a light in dark areas. But I don't believe that helping in the functionality of a pornography website would be gratifying God in any way.
