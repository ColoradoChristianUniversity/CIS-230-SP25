## Prompt
You are a Computer Science professor at a local university teaching C Sharp to some very smart business students. In the second week of class, you spend an entire lecture with your students exhaustively talking about software plagiarism and copyright law with a Christian intellectual property attorney who makes it truly clear that taking code from another developer or site then calling it your own is not only legally wrong but morally wrong. In addition, your institution publishes the following policy:

Plagiarism includes using someone else's data file as your own or representing the work of others as your own.

The penalty for violating the academic integrity code is severe. Any student violating the academic integrity code may receive a failing grade for the course and will be reported. If a student is unclear about whether a particular situation may constitute an academic integrity violation, the student should meet with the instructor to discuss the situation.

For this class, it is permissible to assist classmates in general discussions and such general advice and interaction is encouraged. Each person, however, must develop his or her own solutions to the assigned projects, assignments, and tasks. In other words, students may not "work together" on graded assignments unless specifically assigned to a group task by the course instructor. Such unauthorized collaboration would constitute cheating. A student may not use or copy (by any means) another's work (or portions of it) and represent it as his or her own.

Then this...

Just a week or two into class, one of your students submits an assignment that is very good. Too good? You check and discover the code is identical to a C# tutorial on the internet. It is clear the student copied the code. The writing is on the wall. But remember, you love this student: you don't want to overreact. But you love your other students too: you want to be fair. You are also a new professor at this university: you don't want to underreact. A lot to think about. What do you do?


### Response #1: Enforce the Policy
#### 1. Pros

- Upholds academic integrity.
- Prevents other students from thinking they can get away with plagiarism.
- Promotes fairness.

#### 2. Cons

- Impacts students' academic careers.
- Can create a fear-based environment.

#### 3. Script

**Me:** "I need to talk to you about your latest assignment. After reviewing your submission, I found that your code is identical to a code posted online. This constitutes plagiarism. I have no choice but to report it and assign you a failing grade."

**Student:** "Professor, I'm sorry, I just didn't know how to do the assignment. Am I able to redo it?"

**Me:** "I will not allow you to redo this assignment. However, if you need help understanding the material moving forward, I would be more than happy to assist you."

#### 4. Scripture

*Ecclesiastes 8:11*  
>"When the sentence for a crime is not quickly carried out, people's hearts are filled with schemes to do wrong."

#### 5. First Principle
"When academic success is not earned, the achievement and effort become meaningless. This prepares the student for the real world, where, instead of a bad grade, plagiarism can result in losing a job or facing potential lawsuits."

### Option 2: Give a One-Time Warning and Offer Another Chance
#### Pros

- Encourages growth without suffering severe consequences.
- Saves the student from potential course-related issues.
- The student may become more focused on school after this confrontation.

#### Cons

- Others may be upset that the plagiarism went unpunished. 
- Other students may think they can get away with plagiarism.
- Weakens the message that plagiarism is a serious offense.

#### Script

**Me:** "After reviewing your assignment, I noticed that it matches a publicly accessible C# code. This is considered plagiarism. I could choose to fail you, but I'm going to extend grace this time. I'm giving you a one-time warning and will allow you to submit a new assignment with your own work."

**Student:** "Thank you for giving me another chance to complete this. I'm sorry for how I handled it."

**Me:** "Sounds good. Just make sure to come to me first. Asking for help is not a bad thing, especially before considering plagiarism."

#### Scripture

*James 2:13* 
>"Because judgment without mercy will be shown to anyone who has not been merciful. Mercy triumphs over judgment."

#### 5. First Principle
"One mistake does not define a person, but it is essential that they understand the consequences of their actions. Offering a second chance—while emphasizing the seriousness of the offense—creates an opportunity for growth and learning."

### Option 3: Have the student redo the assignment with a deducted grade
#### 1. Pros

- Maintains fairness.
- Brings a learning opportunity.

#### 2. Cons

- Could lead to potential use of plagiarism.
- Not adhering to the official policy.

#### 3. Script

**Me:** "I noticed that your recent assignment is identical to an online source of code. Since this is your first offense, I want to use this as a learning opportunity. I will allow you to redo the assignment, but with a grade penalty. If this happens again, I will not be so lenient."

**Student:** "Thank you for allowing me a second chance. I was just confused about what to do."

**Me:** "If you ever feel stuck, just ask for help, and I'll assist however I can."

#### 4. Scripture

*Proverbs 10:9* 
> "Whoever walks in integrity walks securely, but whoever takes crooked paths will be found out."

#### 5. First Principle
"Giving a second chance with consequences will foster growth while ensuring that accountability is maintained."

## Excursus

The ethical dilemma in this scenario revolves around the professor's responsibility to uphold academic integrity while also providing an opportunity for growth. The professor must find a balance between ensuring the student understands the seriousness of their actions and recognizing that one mistake does not define their future. From a Christian perspective, we also need to acknowledge grace and redemption. It is very important to seek justice when one does wrong, but offering a chance to repent and make amends aligns with biblical principles of forgiveness. How the professor handles this situation is pivotal for the student. It can help the student learn from their mistakes and also grow in who they are as a person as a result.

## My Choice

"I would choose option 3 for the first time around. I believe that option 2 doesn't adequately recognize the severity of the offense. On the other hand, I think option 1 can create an environment where the student feels their best interests are not considered. Option 3 strikes a middle ground that I think is very beneficial. There are still consequences, so the student will understand the impact of their actions and be challenged to avoid repeating them in the future, while also being given a chance to learn and grow from the experience."
