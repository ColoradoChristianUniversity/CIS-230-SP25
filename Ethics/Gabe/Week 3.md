# Question
###### While maintaining an extremely popular Open-Source project, authorities contact you asking that you introduce back door code to allow them to gather the needed evidence to stop an online child trafficking scheme. What are three responses? What do you do?

## Response #1 - Refuse to Build the Backdoor for the Authorities

## Pros:
#### - This will maintain trust and preserve user privacy.
#### - Less risk of the code being misused in the future.

## Cons:
#### - Hinders the ability to stop a large issue.
#### - Authorities could press legal action.
#### - Can be seen as secretive or as if you're hiding something.
#### - Could get fired or arrested.

## Script:
#### Authorities: We've been monitoring an online trafficking scheme, and we need your help. We believe a backdoor to your open-source project could help us gather evidence to shut this down.
#### Me: I understand the weight of this situation. But, our project was built to be private and secure. Adding a backdoor would compromise the foundation of this.
#### Authorities: I understand, but this is an urgent concern. Could you make an exception?
#### Me: I understand, but we cannot sacrifice the security of our project and our users for this.

## Scripture:
### Matthew 5:37
#### "Let your 'Yes' be 'Yes,' and your 'No,' 'No'; anything beyond this comes from the evil one."

## Principle 
#### Integrity is essential for building and maintaining trust. We cannot break that trust, even if it is for a good cause.


## Response #2 - Bring in the Backdoor but with Full Transparency

## Pros:
#### - Balances privacy with the greater good of the public.
#### - Shows that you are cooperating with law enforcement while still protecting user rights.

## Cons:
#### - Still brings a loss of trust in the long term.
#### - May lead to other authorities asking for similar requests, making it harder to refuse.
#### - Could face potential legal challenges, as it might be perceived as breaching privacy laws.

## Script
#### Authorities: We need access to your code to prevent a child trafficking operation. Can you build a backdoor so we can monitor the situation?
#### Me: We are willing to cooperate, but I will need to be transparent with the users. They must be informed about the backdoor and its purpose.
#### Authorities: This could complicate things. It could potentially compromise the effectiveness of the investigation.
#### Me: I cannot take the risk of hiding this from our users. If we fail to be transparent, we jeopardize the security of our system.
#### Authorities: I understand. This is not ideal, but we'll take what we can get.

## Scripture
### Matthew 7:12
#### "So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you."

## Principle
#### Transparency helps avoid deception and builds future respect. It is also morally justifiable as it protects vulnerable children.

## Response #3: Comply Fully with the Authorities

## Pros
#### - May have the best direct and immediate impact on stopping the trafficking scheme.
#### - Avoids obstructing justice and legal troubles.
#### - Could save the lives of children.

## Cons
#### - Undermines trust and security of the project.
#### - Could lead to potential misuse of the backdoor in the future. 

## Script
#### Authorities: We need access to your code to stop a child trafficking scheme. Will you build a backdoor into your open-source project to help us?
#### Me: Given the severity of this situation, I believe this is the right thing to do.
#### Authorities: Thank you for your help. We appreciate your full cooperation.

## Scripture 
### Micah 6:8
#### "He has shown you, O mortal, what is good. And what does the Lord require of you? To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God."

## Principle
#### Compassion for the vulnerable. The urgency of stopping this scheme outweighs the privacy concerns in this case.

## Excursus
#### The ethical dilemma here is deciding which values to prioritize. Whether this is between privacy and trust, or justice and protection. Users rely on the transparency of your software, and building a backdoor would compromise their trust and undermine their privacy. However, there is also the value of preventing further exploitation and saving innocent lives. The ethical dilemma is whether to prioritize the long-term stability of the project or the immediate need to act to save lives.


## My Choice
#### I would choose Response #3. As a Christian, there is a concern for the vulnerable and the oppressed. The weight of saving lives outweighs the weight of needing another paycheck. Child trafficking is an evil and horrible crime. The Bible also tells us that we need to submit to our governing authorities, and going against them in this situation is the wrong decision. This is the best decision as it can save lives and seeks the well being of others.
