## Question
This week is different

ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è The root of this site has the ethics write-up of everyone in class. You can go there, and you can browse and read anyone's essays. Looking back on the first 5 week's prompts, choose the one that resonated with you most. Pick two other students in class and read their options and their choices. In this week's essay, summarize each of those responses with a simple bullet list in your own file and then pretend THEIR CHOICES are the only choices you have (don't go back and revisit your essay for the prompt). Given their choices only, which would YOU choose? Do you agree with the authors? Explain why or why not.

## Selected Week: 04
### Answers From Classmates

### Levi
* **Comfort the teammate as time allows, offer to talk more during a break or after work, and suggest therapy.**
    - This assumes that there is still some time left in the project.
* **Validate their struggle, but ask them to push through if the project is almost done.**
    - This is because the project is too critical to fail, and there are jobs at stake.
    - This also assumes there is a short time remaining.
* **Suggest that you or they talk to the supervisor about small fixes, like reassigning tasks, assuming the supervisor is open to it.**
    - Could help ease their load.
    - This assumes that the depression could be tied to the job and that there is still a good amount of time left.

### Brady
* **Talk more with the teammate and walk them through it.**
    - This will build trust and prioritize the worker's life over work.
    - Shows compassion, as Christians are called to be.
* **Ensure their safety by alerting management discreetly.**
    - If the coworker is at risk, bringing in management is for their own good.
* **Take on some of their work to lighten the load.**
    - This fulfills the call to bear others' burdens. 

## My Reflection

There are numerous good options that both Levi and Brady bring up. Levi's choices are a little more laid back, as he is trying to keep things rolling: be kind, finish the project, and maybe rearrange some tasks. Brady is more focused on how the coworker is doing mentally, even if it comes at the cost of the project. So, when choosing which option to go with, it's important to keep in mind that if we lose the client, there could be serious repercussions. But if we ignore the teammate, we could overload him and make things worse, sending him down a worse path.

I'd go with Brady's first choice: talk more and stick with them. This is the choice that, if I were really in this scenario, I'd pick. Depression is no joke, and not focusing on his mental health could really affect him in the long term. Jesus walked with the broken and showed love in the moment when they needed it, not later. In Galatians 6:2, the Bible says to "bear one another's burdens," putting people first before work. I'd also pray for this person and ask God to give them strength.

For the most part, I agree with Brady. He puts the person over the job. It's not perfect, as the project would more than likely crash. Levi's push-through-it choice would also make sense only if the project is coming to a close. I think, out of all 6 of these possible choices, the "talk more and stick with them" scenario is the best one to go with.
