| May give a chance for sharing your views.         | Limits your ability to get out of this later. |


#### 3. Script

**Me:** [Response to Email] "Thank you for the email! I've updated my signature as requested."

**HR:** "Thank you for doing that. We'll be looking forward to you picking up your rainbow pin."

**Me:** "Sounds good, see you then!"


#### 4. Scripture
