## Prompt
While working your dream job for a major engineering firm, you get an email from HR: immediately put your "preferred pronouns" in your email signature and show up this Thursday with a ðŸŒˆ rainbow pin to help celebrate diversity and inclusion. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

### Response #1: Do as the Email Says, Comply Fully

| Pros                          | Cons                                   |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Better Team Culture.           | Compromises Individual Beliefs and values.         |
| Job Security.                |   Others assume you fully support.   |
| May give a chance for sharing your views.         | Limits your ability to get out of this later. |


#### 3. Script

**Me:** [Response to Email] "Thank you for the email! I've updated my signature as requested."

**HR:** "Thank you for doing that. We'll be looking forward to you picking up your rainbow pin."

**Me:** "Sounds good, see you then!"


#### 4. Scripture

*Romans 12:18*  
>"If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone."

#### 5. First Principle
By complying to the request, this is a step to build relationship which can give you a stronger platform later to share my faith. Opening doors now can create meaningful conversations later.

### Response 2: Ignore the Email


| Pros                          | Cons                                   |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Maintains your beliefs. | Risks Job Security.    |
Allows you to focus on your work. | Weakens Relationship with Team.   | 

#### Script

**Me:** [Shuts off Laptop after reading email]

**Coworker:** "Hey did you read the email from HR?"

**Me:** "Yea, that's not really my thing so I'm not going to mess with it for right now."

**Coworker:** "Fair enough."

#### Scripture

*Daniel 3:18* 
>"But even if he does not, we want you to know, Your Majesty, that we will not serve your gods or worship the image of gold you have set up."

#### 5. First Principle
Being steadfast in your beliefs shows the meaning in what you believe. This values personal values over corporate expectation. 

### Response 3: Respond to the Email Privately with some Pushback

| Pros                          | Cons                                   |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Honors your Values and Beliefs.   | Risk Backlash from HR.       |
Keeps it professional while seeking compromise. | Strain your Reputation   | 

#### 3. Script

**Me:** [Response to Email] "Hi, I got your note about the pronouns and pin. I'm not sure that I am comfortable externally supporting something that I don't necessarily agree with.

**HR:** "Thank you for reaching out. I see your point, we'd prefer full participation in this. Come by on Thursday, and we can talk more and figure out something."

**Me:** "I appreciate that, I'd be happy to talk about it more."

#### 4. Scripture

*Ephesians 4:15* 
> "Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will grow to become in every respect the mature body of him who is the head, that is, Christ."

#### 5. First Principle
Voicing your discomfort keeps your actions aligned with your belief. Seeking a solution that respects both sides. Balancing your truth and respect.
