## Prompt
You're a software engineer in America. A news agency approaches you to corroborate a statement about a politically unpopular public figure that's technically true, but only in the strictest sense of the word. You suspect their agenda is to publicly cancel this person. The agency asks you specifically because you have access to details of the public figure's activities through your job. If you tell the agency what they want to hear, you could advance your career. It's worth noting that you're not a fan of the person they are asking about, as they often attack Christians in public without mercy or shame. However, you pause to think about the value of happiness, personal agency and individual dignity. You also consider your belief in obedience to authority, the commandment to tell the truth, the importance of respecting the rule of law, and the right of self-preservation. What are three possible responses? What do you do?


### Response #1: Tell Them to Use Publicly Available Information

| Pros                          | Cons                                   |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Keeps professionalism and respects the workplace.  | Could affect career gain.     |
|  Will build credibility.      |   Upsets the Agency.  |



#### 3. Script

**Me:** "I can't share that information, but there is enough public information for you to verify your information."

**Agency:** "We know you have access to better details; this could speed up your career."

**Me:** "I won't sell out just for personal gain. Check the public sources if that's what you're wanting."


#### 4. Scripture

*Proverbs 22:1*  
>"A good name is more desirable than great riches; to be esteemed is better than silver or gold."

#### 5. First Principle
Truth must be shared in a morally correct way. Redirecting to public information is smart, as it avoids misuse of your role. Honor God through your actions; you are not the judge of this person's life.

### Response 2: Negotiate with Agency


| Pros                          | Cons                                   |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Could secure career advancement.    | Agency might reject.     |
Allows you to make sure your input is used wisely. | Potential Misuse.    | 

#### Script

**Me:** "I can confirm this statement if you give your word not to spin my words."

**Agency:** "Why the pushback? We don't spin others' words."

**Me:** "You do. I'm saying I'll share this if you can avoid that and sign off on it."

**Agency:** "We can do that. What can you share?"

#### Scripture

*James 3:18* 
>"Peacemakers who sow in peace reap a harvest of righteousness."

#### 5. First Principle
The truth should not be used to bring harm against others, even if that person is speaking ill of you.

### Response 3: Share All the Data with Them.
| Pros                          | Cons                                   |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Secures career advancement.    | Weakens testimony as you place career over people.   |
Voice disapproval of this person's attacks. | Violates Professional Ethics.  | 

#### 3. Script

**Me:** "My records confirm the statement. Here is everything that I can pull on this."

**Agency:** "Thank you! What all is here?"

**Me:** "Everything that you need to verify the claim is here. Use it as you see fit."

#### 4. Scripture

*Exodus 20:16* 
> "You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor."

#### 5. First Principle
Avoiding false testimony means sharing all the data and not holding back. This prioritizes truth as a Christian.

## Excursus
The ethical dilemma here is forcing you to find your way through truth as a Christian. This request is tempting you to feed into a "cancel" campaign for your own personal gain and career advancement. Love calls you to protect this person even though they come after your faith. Your choice shapes your witness; this brings you a chance to embody love and grace, especially in a world where the culture is so quick to "cancel" and condemn others.

## My Choice
I think, in all honesty, I would do Choice 1 – Redirect to Public Sources. This does not misuse my job’s private access. Unless it was confirmed by a boss of mine to share the information, I would not risk my authority. As I am withholding certain data, I am protecting the person’s future and also reflecting Christ’s call to love our enemies, even when they are attacking Christians. This is a low-risk approach that will minimize conflict with my job and the agency.
