## Prompt
You're a software engineer in America. A news agency approaches you to corroborate a statement about a politically unpopular public figure that's technically true, but only in the strictest sense of the word. You suspect their agenda is to publicly cancel this person. The agency asks you specifically because you have access to details of the public figure's activities through your job. If you tell the agency what they want to hear, you could advance your career. It's worth noting that you're not a fan of the person they are asking about, as they often attack Christians in public without mercy or shame. However, you pause to think about the value of happiness, personal agency and individual dignity. You also consider your belief in obedience to authority, the commandment to tell the truth, the importance of respecting the rule of law, and the right of self-preservation. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

**Me:** "Hi, I wanted to let you know that I found a major bug in the system. Due to the urgency, I think I should fix it now, even though it's Sunday, rather than risk bigger issues potentially arising."

**Me:** "Of course, I'll keep you updated!"

#### Script

**Me:** Hi, I found a major bug in the system last night. I know this is urgent, but I'm committed to taking Sundays off. I can address this with the team and see if someone else can look at it. If not, I'll look at it first thing on Monday.

**Management:** "I understand. Let's see if someone else can get on top of that, otherwise it can wait till Monday."

**Me:** "Thank you, I'll be ready on Monday!"

#### Scripture

*Exodus 20:8* 
>"Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy."

#### 5. First Principle

### Response 3: Contact Leadership and Let Them Decide
| Pros                          | Cons                                   |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Shows that you are seeking guidance.          | Leadership could put blame on you.       |
This ensures that the best decision can be made. | May not give a decision by the time it's needed.      | 

#### 3. Script

**Me:** "Hey, I found a pretty major bug. I know I've made a commitment to rest on Sundays, but I want to know how you would handle this scenario?"

**Management:** "Thanks for letting me know. I'll see if it can wait or if someone else can handle it."

**Me:** "Okay thank you. I'll be ready when you need me."

#### 4. Scripture

*1 Peter 5:5* 
> "In the same way, you who are younger, submit yourselves to your elders. All of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, because God opposes the proud but shows favor to the humble."

#### 5. First Principle
"This response shows the value of others' input. Then the whole team will benefit from leadership, rather than that pressure solely laying on you."

## Excursus
The ethical dilemma shown here highlights the tension between fulfilling your professional responsibility and honoring God's commandment. As Christians, the call to rest is important, but it is also crucial that we recognize our responsibility to fulfill our professional duties. Choosing to fix the issue immediately may not honor the Lord's commandment, but delaying your duty to rest is biblically important as well. Here, we need to discern whether or not to take action or stay true to what the Lord commanded. Either way, your decision should still honor the Lord.


## My Choice
I think realistically, I would go with Choice 3. I find myself leaning towards Choice 2 because of that full commitment to rest. But even though this is restful, it does not fulfill my responsibility as a professional. Choice 3 is smart because it shows humility, as I won't make decisions alone, and trust in my leadership. Management knows how important rest is to me, and from what I understand, they have honored that commitment. By letting them know, if they want me to work, then I will know how urgent the scenario is. This upholds my values and my responsibilities. Ultimately, Choice 3 is the best decision.
