## Prompt
You're a software engineer in America. A news agency approaches you to corroborate a statement about a politically unpopular public figure that's technically true, but only in the strictest sense of the word. You suspect their agenda is to publicly cancel this person. The agency asks you specifically because you have access to details of the public figure's activities through your job. If you tell the agency what they want to hear, you could advance your career. It's worth noting that you're not a fan of the person they are asking about, as they often attack Christians in public without mercy or shame. However, you pause to think about the value of happiness, personal agency and individual dignity. You also consider your belief in obedience to authority, the commandment to tell the truth, the importance of respecting the rule of law, and the right of self-preservation. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

## Excursus
The ethical dilemma here is forcing you to be able to make your way through truth as a Christian. This request is tempting you to feed into a "cancel" campaign for your own personal gain and career advancement. Love calls you to protect this person even though they come after your faith.Your choice shapes your witness, this brings you a chance to embody love and grace especially in a world where the culture is so quick to 'cancel' and condemn others.

## My Choice
I think in all honesty I would do Choice 1 - Redirect to Public Sources. This does not misuse my job's private access. Unless it was confirmed by a boss of mine to share the information then I would not risk my authority. As I am withholding certain data, I am protecting the person's future, and also reflecting Christs's call to love our enemies, even when they are attacking Christians. This is a low risk approach which will minimize the conflict with my job and the agency.
