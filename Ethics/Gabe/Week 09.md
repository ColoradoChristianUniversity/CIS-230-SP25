## Prompt
While writing some code Saturday night, you realize you have introduced a crippling bug that breaks the entire system. As a Christian, you have politely requested no deadlines, meetings or work ever occur on Sunday. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

### Response #1: Fix the Bug Immediately

| Pros                          | Cons                                   |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Protects the company           | Damages trust with the friend         |
| Shows integrity                | Could delay the project timeline      |
| Prevents future issues         | Might disrupt Sunday rest commitment  |


#### 3. Script

**Me:** "Hi, I wanted to let you know that I found a major bug in the system. Due to the urgency, I think I should fix it now even though it's sunday rather than bigger issues potentially arising."

**Management:** "Thanks for letting me know. I appreciate you sacrificing your time to fix this."

**Me:** "Of course, I'll keep you updated!"


#### 4. Scripture

*Luke 16:10*  
>"Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trust with much, and whoever is dishonest with very little will also be dishonest with much."

#### 5. First Principle
"Taking immediate action to fix this bug will show that you have a commitment to uphold the responsibility that has been put on you. This shows reliability and that your committed with integrity."

### Option 2: Tell your Team, but Wait Until Monday to Move Forward
#### Pros

| Pros                          | Cons                                   |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Honors your commitment to your Sabbath.          | May seem lazy to management.        |
Allows your team to step in and work on it. | Could bring more issues to the system        | 

#### Script

**Me:** "Hi, I found a major bug in the system last night. I know this is urgent, but I'm committed to taking off Sundays. I can address this with the team and see if someone else can look at it. If not, I'll look at it first thing on Monday."

**Management:** "I understand. Let's see if someone else can get on top of that, otherwise it can wait till Monday."

**Me:** "Thank you, I'll be ready on Monday!"

#### Scripture

*Exodus 20:8* 
>"Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy."

#### 5. First Principle
"Honoring God's command to rest is more essential than breaking this commitment work."

### Option 3: Contact Leadership and Let Them Decide
| Pros                          | Cons                                   |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Shows that you are seeking guidance.          | Leadership could put blame on you       |
This ensures that the best decision can be made. | May not give a decision by the time it's needed.      | 

#### 3. Script

**Me:** "Hey, I found a pretty major bug. I know I've made a commitment to rest on Sundays, but I want to know how you would handle this scenario?"

**Management** "Thanks for letting me know. I'll see if it can wait or if someone else can handle it."

**Me:** "Okay thank you. I'll be ready when you need me."

#### 4. Scripture

*1 Peter 5:5* 
> "In the same way, you who are younger, submit yourselves to your elders. All of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, because God opposes the proud but shows favor to the humble."

#### 5. First Principle
"This response shows the value of others input. Then the whole team will benefit from leadership. Rather than that pressure solely laying on you."

## Excursus
The ethical dilemma that is show here shows the tension between doing your professional responsibility and honoring God's commandment. As Christians, the call to rest is important, but it is also important that we recognize our responsibility to fulfill our professional duties. Choosing to fix will not honor the Lord's commitment. But delaying your duty to your job to rest is biblically important as well. Here, we need to discern whether or not to take action or staying true to what the Lord commanded. Either way, your decision should still honor the Lord. 


## My Choice
I think realistically, I would go with choice 3. I find myself leaning towards Choice 2 because of that full commitment to rest. But even though this is restful, it does not achieve my responsibility as a professional. Choice 3 is smart because it shows that there is humility as I won't make decisions alone, and trust in my leadership. The Management knows how important the rest is to me, and from what I understand, they have honored that commitment. By letting them know, if they want me to work then I know how urgent of a scenario this is. This upholds my values and my responsibilites. Choice 3 is ultimately the best decision.
