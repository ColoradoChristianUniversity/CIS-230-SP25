## Prompt
You are part of a development team for a software company creating a machine learning tool that can identify subtle items in large data sets. The government agency funding this tool plans to use it to identify religious references in public places that have gone unnoticed for years until put under the scrutiny of your tool. They hope to stall religious conflict by removing whatever your tool identifies through strict regulation to better secularize public places. You are excited about the success of a tool you have worked hard to perfect for years.

#### 3. Script

**Me:** "Hi, I wanted to say that I am super excited about the progress of the tool so far. I am also a bit uneasy about how it could be used."

**Management:** "What's wrong with it? They are just trying to keep these spaces neutral."

**Me:** "I can understand that, but targeting religious references feels like it steps on freedom."

## Excursus
The ethical dilemma taking place in this scenario is between the joy in a new machine that is groundbreaking and the unease about the role it is playing in taking away religious presence from the public. As Christians, we must honor our call to honor God. We must act in a way that reflects Christ while also still helping bring growth in the workplace and in yourself.

## My Choice
I would go with option 3, Internally Voice Concerns. This honors my faith-based concerns about how I feel about suppressing religion. This can potentially lead to redirecting the purpose of the tool and using it for something that is more suitable. And it preserves my job.
