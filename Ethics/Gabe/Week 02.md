# Question
###### While working as an engineer at a Consultancy, you are assigned to project using Machine Learning to improve customer efficiency. When successful, the customer plans to lay off more than 175 employees. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

## Response #1 - Raise Ethical Concerns and Address Potential Impact

## Pros:
#### - Strengthens relationships and builds trust with fellow coworkers

#### - Shows Leadership
 
## Cons:

## Script:
#### Me: "I wanted to bring up some concerns regarding the impact this project would have on employees. I stand firmly on the side that we should consider the human side of this. Is there any way we can do this project but still keep workers so their jobs aren't taken?" 
#### Client: "I see where you are coming from, but the whole goal of this is to reduce costs and improve productivity."
#### Me: "I understand, but I think we should still think about broader implications. Could we explore other options?"
#### Client:"Hmm, I can be open to ideas. Let's discuss potential paths we can take."

## Scripture:
### Proverbs 31:8-9 
#### --- "Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves, for the rights of all who are destitute. Speak up and judge fairly; defend the rights of the poor and needy."

#### - Can lead to career growth

## Cons:
#### - You may face pressure to prioritize results over employee well-being
#### - Taking the lead means shouldering all the risk, including potential backlash if layoffs result 

## Script
#### Me: "I understand the goal of this project, and I'm excited to take the lead to ensure we execute it well."
#### Client: "Thank you for taking the lead on this project. I'm confident you'll do great."

## Scripture
### Proverbs 16:3
#### "Commit to the Lord whatever you do, and he will establish your plans."

## Cons
#### - Time-consuming
#### - The return on investment is uncertain, making it harder to sell the idea
#### - Management could see it as you being too soft and unable to make the necessary decisions

## Script
#### Me: "I think we should take a step back and think about how we can do this project while still focusing on long-term sustainability. Let's explore how we can bring growth and new opportunities from within the company."
#### Manager: "We are focused on reducing costs right now. We should stay focused on that."
#### Me: "I understand, but we risk losing valuable knowledge from the people who have brought value to our company."
#### Manager: "If you can find an efficient plan that still creates value and reduces costs, I’d be more than happy to go along with this."
#### Me: "Okay, great! I’ll start exploring potential ideas and run them by you."

## Scripture 
### Proverbs 11:1
#### "The Lord detests dishonest scales, but accurate weights find favor with him."

## First Principle
#### We shouldn’t be solely focused on immediate goals but should consider the future consequences. Avoid extremes and utilize the resources that we already have. 

## Excursus
#### The decision in this situation is a heavy one, as it does not just involve financial considerations, but also ethical concerns. The ethical dilemma revolves around the potential harm to employees that will come if we move forward with the use of Machine Learning. The customer wants to implement this technology to reduce costs, but this will most likely result in a high number of layoffs. The key question is whether the company should prioritize maximized profit at the cost of worker job security. As Christians, we should put people first and serve others, ensuring that money does not come above the livelihoods of others


## My Choice
#### I would go with Choice #3: Propose a more balanced approach. This considers both the technological needs and the well-being of the employees in the company. Raising ethical concerns may not have as much impact as bringing a balanced approach would, but taking the lead without considering the consequences could bring unintended harm. This choice minimizes harm and promotes fairness for workers, aligning with the principles of respect and sustainability.
