# Question:
While working on a project under intense budget and time pressures, a key teammate shares with you in confidence that he is suffering from debilitating depression. If this project fails, your company will lose their largest customer. What are three responses? What do you do?
# Dilemma Breakdown:
The issues with this situation stem from the importance and constraints of this project. The importance of the customer means we have no choice but to work within the limitations due to the benefit this provides the company. These constraints, in turn, cause two problems.
1. Intense budget constraints mean that hiring a new person to replace him for some much-needed recovery time is not an option.
2. Intense time constraints mean that this person needs to keep working on the project since offloading their entire workload would be too much of a risk and burden.
However, this dilemma is complicated to answer with the provided information. How I would respond to this situation depends highly on the specifics.

**Therefore, I will provide three possible responses to three situations.**

# Response 1: Comfort them for as much as time allows, be willing to talk about it more at a break or after work, but ultimately suggest therapy.
### Response 1 Assumptions:
- There is a substantial amount of time left in the project
- They choose not to disclose any significant details of the cause of the depression at any point
### Reasoning:
There is a person who is suffering and quite vulnerable in front of me; there is very little reason why I should dismiss them or ignore them. However, with the intense time constraints of the project, it is reasonable to assume that only a tiny amount of time could be spent counseling or comforting the coworker.
Therefore, you should comfort and be there for them as much as possible, but because of the time constraint, mention how you are open to discussing the matter further during other times off work, like over break or after work. It is going out of your way, but Jesus did things for people even when it was inconvenient for Him.
In addition, you are, most likely, not a therapist of any kind. You can listen and provide support as much as possible, but someone specializing in handling these issues would also help immensely. Therefore, the ultimate goal is to support them within reason and suggest a therapist for possible treatments, which could be redundant if they are already treating it but still necessary.
### Pros:
- Showing your support and presence to someone who desperately needs it
- Taking the time to show someone you care and are willing to walk with them helps ease people's burdens.
### Cons:
- If the time requirements are so strict that you don't have time to chat at all, this may not work.
- It gives you an unexpected "obstacle/burden" that you may be unable to handle or desire.
### Expected Dialogue:
- Coworker: "Sorry that took so long; I finally finished it."
- Me: "Thanks. Are you all right? Is there something going on you want to talk about."
- Coworker: "Oh, I wouldn't want to burden you with anything."
- Me: "Are you sure? Try me; I got some time."
- Coworker: "Well... "

* Coworker: "Well... that's a whole other story..."
* Me: "Hey, it's all right; unfortunately, I have other work I need to do because of these crazy time constraints, but I'm honored you decided to share that with me. If you want, I'm willing to talk to you at lunch or after work."
* Coworker: "Oh yeah, um... maybe. We'll see, I guess. Sorry."
* Me: "Again, I'm honored you shared that with me, and I'd love to talk more and help. This project is critical. Also, looking into a therapist might not be the worst idea. I'm still willing to help as much as I can, but I'm also just an engineer; they would be able to help in ways I wouldn't know how."
* Coworker: "Well... I appreciate it, and I'll think about it."
### Verse: 1 Thessalonians 5:11
"Therefore encourage one another and build one another up, just as you are doing."
### First Principle: Love
Someone is hurting before you and choosing to be vulnerable to you. Despite these time constraints, you should show love and concern just as Jesus would.

# Response 2: Value and validate their situation, but request they push through the short time we have left until the project is done.
### Response 2 Assumption:
* There is only a short amount of time left in the project.
### Reasoning:
Due to the importance of this project, if your team fails, none of you might have a job coming back. Therefore, if there is a small amount of time left in the project, like a week or less, everyone needs to focus and complete the project.
Yes, they are vulnerable and taking a risk disclosing this information to you, which is why it is still important to value and validate their situation. In fact, it would be much better to discuss it with more time and attention after the time crunch is over.
This also doesn't mean you have to be stagnant about the situation; you should start praying for them now that you know some information and ask God for guidance. However, you must still keep your job to provide for your family.
### Pros:
- Still attempts to show you still value and are willing to love the person.
- Encourages you and the teammate to complete the project and keep your jobs.
- Give you time to pray over the person & ask for guidance on how to proceed.
### Cons:
- Could shut down the conversation entirely since you are waiting a while.
- Could be the exact wrong thing the person wanted to hear: to wait.
- Work could be the cause of the debilitating depression, and pushing through will only make it worse.
### Expected Dialogue:
- Coworker: "Sorry that took so long; I finally got it done."
- Me: "Thanks. Are you all right? Is there something going on?"
- Coworker: "Oh, I wouldn't want to burden you with anything."
- Me: "Try me. I got a bit of time."
- Coworker: "Well... "
---
* Coworker: "Well... that's a whole other story..."
* Me: "Hey, it's all right; unfortunately, you know the situation we are in with how important this project is. I'm honored you decided to share that with me; however, due to the importance of the project and how close it is to being done, I'm unable to give you the time that talk deserves. But we are almost through the worst of it, and I am willing to give you the necessary time outside of work once this is all over."
* Coworker: "Oh yeah, that makes sense... sorry I mentioned it."
* Me: "No, no, it's ok. I'm truly honored that you decided to share this with me, and I really do care. It's just annoying how insane this project is for everyone, and that conversation requires time and consideration, which I can truly give to you once this project is over."
* Coworker: "Sure... thanks..."
### Verse: Ecclesiastes 3:1
"There is a timeÂ for everything, and a season for every activity under the heavens."
### First Principle: Proper care and attention
Debilitating depression is a dire situation and requires serious conservations to show that you love, care, and are willing to fight for them. However, the importance of this project means that to keep both of your jobs, you should focus on their completion first so you can give the proper care and attention this situation requires.

# Response 3: Suggest that you or the teammate ask the supervisor if anything can be done to alleviate immediate problems.
### Response 3 Assumptions:
- There is a substantial amount of time left in the project
- They disclose that the depression is work-related.
### Reasoning:
This response only works if the depression is caused by work in some way. Telling the teammate to bring it up the chain is probably the exact response they did not want to hear.
Therefore, this response should be used in such a way as to suggest small solutions to ease the situation while still keeping the teammate's feelings confidential if they desire. For example, if a minor cause of the job depression is because he was assigned to develop a part of the back end they despise, a minor fix could be swapping that job with someone else.
The point of this response is that if the supervisor understands the teammate's request, they could alleviate some of the minor problems to lift the teammate's spirits a bit, pushing them forward.
### Pros:
- Opens the possibility of small but tangible solutions to help ease their mental state immediately.
- Supervisors could be trained to deal with these situations and have access to resources you do not have.
- Partially takes the situation off your hands.
### Cons:
- Job depression problems will often not have immediate and straightforward solutions.
- They could have already shared this with the supervisor and got shut down, rendering this response useless.
### Expected Dialogue:
- Coworker: "Sorry that took so long; I finally got it done."
- Me: "Thanks. Are you all right? Is there something going on?"
- Coworker: "Oh, I wouldn't want to burden you with anything."
- Me: "Are you sure? Try me. I got a bit of time."
- Coworker: "Well... you know about this project's backend development, right?"
- Me: "Yeah, I was surprised you got assigned that. Don't you hate doing it?"
- Coworker: "Yup, and honestly, it's just been one of the many things causing... well... you have a right to know at this point... I've been suffering from debilitating depression, mostly due to work."
- Me: "Oh no, that's awful. I'm so sorry to hear that. Do you want to talk about it at all? I'm right here?"
- Coworker: "Well... not really... but maybe sometime later."
- Me: "Fair enough. Does the supervisor know? He might not assign you those if they did, despite what you might think, they have a heart too."
- Coworker: "I suppose..."
- Me: "You also don't have to mention that at all, but I assume you've already asked to be taken off those before, right?"
- Coworker: "Not formally..."
- Me: "Well, I'm truly honored you decided to share this with me, and I'm willing to talk to you about it more if you like, or just let me know if you'd like my help talking to the supervisor about it."
- Coworker: "Sure I will, thanks."
### Verse: 1 Corinthians 1:10
I appeal to you, brothers and sisters, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree with one another in what you say and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be perfectly united in mind and thought.
### First Principle: Immediate help
The idea is to help in a tangible way as soon as possible. It will seldom be the only solution, but it can provide meaningful results for a healthy step forward.
# My Choice:
Given all the options presented, option 1 is the most likely to occur and the path I would follow. In my experience, simply showing that you care and are there for them is one of the best responses in this situation. Yes, it would be accepting a burden onto yourself, but this is also an excellent opportunity to share the love of Christ.
In addition, the other options appear too situational, and some of them could be entirely unhelpful.
