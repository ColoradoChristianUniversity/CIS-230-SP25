<h1>Question
<h3>
While working as an engineer at a Consultancy, you are assigned to a project using Machine Learning to improve customer efficiency. When successful, the customer plans to lay off more than 175 employees. What are three possible responses? What do you do?
<h1> Answer

<h2>Option 1: Stay quiet and let the customer make the decisions for their company

<h2>Pros:

- The customer will be inclined to use your consultancy services again

- Will show a willingness to perform the task assigned to you without question

- May lead to better customer relations and percieved reliability of the consultancy

<h2> Cons:

- Has an immense impact on families and good workers who need jobs if you say nothing

- Shows a lack of empathy

- Takes away the human element from business and hands it over to algorithms

Script:

- Me: Hi (Customer), we have found that through our machine learning technology we can significantly increase the efficiency of your company. 
- Customer: That would be so helpful! What do we need to do in order to achieve this?
- Me: You can become more efficient by letting over 175 employees go if you are fine with that decision, 100% up to you.

- Customer: Yes let's do that, its not a big deal

Scripture: 

Ecclesisastes 3:7 (NIV) - "A time to tear apart and a time to sew together; A time to be silent and a time to speak."

First Principle:

There is a time for everything, and sometimes it is the best course of action to not provide input on anything other than the job at hand.

<h2>Option 2: Address the negative implications of the decision and consult accordingly 

<h2>Pros:

- Allows for the possibility of not laying 175 off of work based on data

- Can save the customer from legal trouble in the future if workers decide to sue

- Talking about considering the negative impact of the decision will establish credibility as a consultant

<h2> Cons:

- Might be overstepping the bounds of your job

- Customer may become agitated that you think their idea is bad and refuse your business 

Script:

- Me: So, after looking at the machine learning data, it seems the easiest way to meet your efficiency goals would be to lay off a significant part of your work force, however I would advise against this due to the potential setbacks that may occur as a result.
- Customer: Ok but we would really like to achieve our goal and are willing to do whatever it takes even if it means firing people.
- Me: I understand that but firing that many people might hurt you companies brand image and you may fall into legal trouble from angry employees. We can look at alternative strategies that might not have as drastic of a conclusion than firing many of your employees if that would be ok.

-  Customer: I appreciate your input on this scenario, i had not thought of that, yes let's think about some better alternatives. 

Scripture: 

Proverbs 19:2 (NIV) - "Desire without knowledge is not good - how much more will hasty feet miss the way!"

First Principle:

Typically it is best to consider all the options and not jump headfirst into a decision without understanding what might happen as a result.

<h2>Option 3: Remove the option to fire 175 employees from your meeting with the customer

<h2>Pros:

- Entirely removes the possibility of people losing their jobs

- Allows for other less impactful options to be considered

<h2> Cons:

- Possibly not the best ethical option since you are hiding something from your customer

- Could be a problem later if the customer finds out you neglected to give them the most efficient option

Script:

- Me: Ok so after the analysis we have a few options to consider
- Customer: Great! thanks for your work on this
- Me: Of course, we can look into providing more efficient software for your employees to use in addition to rethinking the workflow of your company to try and make things more efficient.
-   Management: Ok we can absolutley implement these changes

Scripture: 

Proverbs 11:13 (NIV): "A man of understanding holds his tongue" 

First Principle:

While it may seem unethical, withholding detrimental information may sometimes be the best choice if it can lead to severe misfortune

Excursus:

This case is an example that happens often in the modern workplace where technology can be used to improve operations and efficiency. While this may be a good thing in many cases there are also implications far beyond the business. These decisions can have an impact on families and livelihoods which is why a high level of discernment must be used to come to the appropriate conclusion. 

My Choice:

In this scenario i would choose option 2 because it allows me to make a case for the best decision while still doing the job i was asked to do unlike option 3. I think that if there are other solutions just as effective to the "best" one according to an algorithm then they should certainly be considered and hopefully acted upon.
