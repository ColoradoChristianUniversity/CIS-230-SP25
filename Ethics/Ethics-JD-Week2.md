<h1>Question
<h3>
While working as an engineer at a Consultancy, you are assigned to a project using Machine Learning to improve customer efficiency. When successful, the customer plans to lay off more than 175 employees. What are three possible responses? What do you do?
<h1> Answer

<h2>Option 1: Stay quiet and let the customer make the decisions for their company

<h2>Pros:

- The customer will be inclined to use your consultancy services again

- Will show a willingness to perform the task assigned to you without question

- May lead to better customer relations and percieved reliability of the consultancy

<h2> Cons:

- Has an immense impact on families and good workers who need jobs if you say nothing

- Shows a lack of empathy

- Takes away the human element from business and hands it over to algorithms

Script:

- Me: Hi (Customer), we have found that through our machine learning technology we can significantly increase the efficiency of your company. 
- Customer: That would be so helpful! What do we need to do in order to achieve this?
- Me: You can become more efficient by letting over 175 employees go if you are fine with that decision, 100% up to you.

- Customer: Yes let's do that, its not a big deal

Scripture: 

Ecclesisastes 3:7 (NIV) - "A time to tear apart and a time to sew together; A time to be silent and a time to speak."

First Principle:

There is a time for everything, and sometimes it is the best course of action to not provide input on anything other than the job at hand.

<h2>Option 2: Address the negative implications of the decision and consult accordingly 

<h2>Pros:

- Allows me to respectfully offer help elsewhere

- Allows morals and standards to be upheld

- Keeps professionalism and reduces the need to make a scene

<h2> Cons:

- May set a bad opinion of your ability to fulfill assigned responsibilities

- Has the potential to escalate and turn into a sour situation if not dealt with correctly or graciously

Script:

- Me: Hi (Supervisor Name), I noticed the project i was just assigned to and was wondering about the possibility of being reassigned to a different project. I feel as if my skills would be better used elsewhere as i am not necessarily comfortable working on this project.
- Supervisor: Ok i understand, while it would be nice to have more people on board for this project i appreciate you coming to me and we can totally get you reassigned.
- Me: Ok thank you I am looking forward to this new project.

Scripture: 

Romans 14:22 (NIV) - "So whatever you believe about these things keep between yourself and God. Blessed is the one who does not condemn himself by what he approves."

First Principle:

There can certainly be a balance between keeping ones dignity and integrity while still being respectful and willing to do work.

<h2>Option 3: Bring your reservations and questions to the higher management

<h2>Pros:

- Instantly makes the immediate reservations known to leadership

- Can potentially save the company a painful issue

- Might be exaclty what others are wanting to do but are too nervous to actually do

<h2> Cons:

- May be percieved as a wish to remove workload or responsibility 

- May lead to questions on the validity of such questions if everyone else is fine with the work

- At an extreme could lead to job loss if leadership doesnt want people asking questions about who to work with

Script:

- Me: Thank you for meeting with me today, i wanted to address some issues going through with serving this client may present. 
- Management: And those are??
- Me: Well, it seems that many of us who would be working in this are uncomfortable with this client and do not think our time and attention should be spent on such divisive cleintel.
-   Management: That is noted however these clients will significantly help our bottom line and if do not wish to work with them then you are not going to work here any longer.

Scripture: 

Proverbs 16:12: - "Good leaders abhor wrongdoing and have a moral foundation."

First Principle:

Even though it can be scary, pushing important decisions up the chain can often be a good idea, regardless the outcome.

Excursus:

This case study highlights the moral tug-o-war we may face in the workplace as Christians. One one hand we can fulfill what is asked of us or we can resist due to our beliefs. Either way we can still handle such situations with respect and professionalism and often find suitable ways around the problem that will satisfy both parties.

My Choice:

I would almost certainly choose option number 2 and ask to be assigned to a different project. This option offers a gracful way to exit the scenario while still allowing you to offer immense value to the company by asking for other work in which to utilize your skills.
