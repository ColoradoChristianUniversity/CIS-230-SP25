## Question

While working as an engineer at a Consultancy, you are assigned to project using Machine Learning to improve customer efficiency. When successful, the customer plans to lay off more than 175 employees. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

## Answer

### Option 1: Research the Layoffs and Determine my Significance
#### 1. Pros

* Helps get a bigger picture and better understanding
* Can alleviate stress and significance
* Helps to make wiser choices if problems/moral issues are still posed

#### 2. Cons

* Can sometimes *complicate* things more
* Can take too long and delay important decisions
* Won't always be helpful

#### 3. Script

**Me:** "Hey, do you know how long this customer has been planning these layoffs and what other factors might be contributing to these layoffs?"

**Manager:** "Yes, they have been planning these layoffs for about a year. While your machine learning project will contribute to these layoffs, they are also implementing several other technologies to also limit thier human workforce."

**Me:** "I see. So while my project is part of the layoffs, it is not the whole picture or the entire reason for the layoffs. They will happen regardless and have been planned for a long time."

#### 4. Scripture

> **Proverbs 15:21** <br> Folly is a joy to him who lacks sense, but a man of *understanding* walks straight ahead <br> (Italics Added)

#### 5. First Principle
Seek to understand. Sometimes when we are faced with moral dilemas, simply asking more questions and seeking to better understand the situation can completely change our perspective. Sometimes things we think are moral dilemas may not even be moral dilemas at all.

### Option 2: Advocate for Redundancy and the Need for Human Workers
#### 1. Pros

* Can help save jobs
* Can help the client better understand what they are asking for
* Can set a better future precedent

#### 2. Cons

* May come off as disrespectful
* Client may be offended and think about asking someone else
* Client may be lead to think I would "sabatoge" the project to help save jobs. Can hurt trust

#### 3. Script

**Me:** "Hello client, while I understand your desire to eliminate the need for expensive human workers, I would like to advise you that it could be tremendously helpful to keep many of the workers you have."

**Client:** "Please explain further."

**Me:** "You see, while this project in machine learning *will* make you more efficeint, having human workers on top of the machine learning can make you even *more efficient*. When both forces combine it can be a tremendous positive. The machine learing can work in harmony with the human workers and they can make you the *most* efficeient you can be. Further, the machine learning will be good but nothing can be perfect. It is also advisable to keep human staff for redundancy and to ensure accuracy."

**Client:** "We see. We did not realize the full implications of our decision and may reconsider how many workers we lay off."

#### 4. Scripture

> **Proverbs 14:25** <br> A truthful witness saves lives, but one who breathes out lies is deceitful.

#### 5. First Principle
Truth is something that can alwasy help. Sometimes people and clients do not fully understand the technology they are asking for. Many times simply communicating how they can better understand something and advocating for truth can help people.
