## Question

While working as an engineer at a Consultancy, you are assigned to project using Machine Learning to improve customer efficiency. When successful, the customer plans to lay off more than 175 employees. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

## Answer

### Option 1: Research the Layoffs and Determine my Significance
#### 1. Pros

* Helps get a bigger picture and better understanding
* Can alleviate stress and significance
* Helps to make wiser choices if problems/moral issues are still posed

#### 2. Cons

* Can sometimes *complicate* things more
* Can take too long and delay important decisions
* Won't always be helpful

#### 3. Script

**Me:** "Hey, do you know how long this customer has been planning these layoffs and what other factors might be contributing to these layoffs?"

**Manager:** "Yes, they have been planning these layoffs for about a year. While your machine learning project will contribute to these layoffs, they are also implementing several other technologies to also limit thier human workforce."

**Me:** "I see. So while my project is part of the layoffs, it is not the whole picture or the entire reason for the layoffs. They will happen regardless and have been planned for a long time."

#### 4. Scripture

> **Proverbs 15:21** <br> Folly is a joy to him who lacks sense, but a man of *understanding* walks straight ahead <br> (Italics Added)

#### 5. First Principle
Seek to understand. Sometimes when we are faced with moral dilemas, simply asking more questions and seeking to better understand the situation can completely change our perspective. Sometimes things we think are moral dilemas may not even be moral dilemas at all.

### Option 2: Advocate for Redundancy and the Need for Human Workers
#### 1. Pros

* Can help save jobs
* Can help the client better understand what they are asking for
* Can set a better future precedent

#### 2. Cons

* May come off as disrespectful
* Client may be offended and think about asking someone else
* Client may be lead to think I would "sabatoge" the project to help save jobs. Can hurt trust

#### 3. Script

**Me:** "Hello client, while I understand your desire to eliminate the need for expensive human workers, I would like to advise you that it could be tremendously helpful to keep many of the workers you have."

**Client:** "Please explain further."

**Me:** "You see, while this project in machine learning *will* make you more efficeint, having human workers on top of the machine learning can make you even *more efficient*. When both forces combine it can be a tremendous positive. The machine learing can work in harmony with the human workers and they can make you the *most* efficeient you can be. Further, the machine learning will be good but nothing can be perfect. It is also advisable to keep human staff for redundancy and to ensure accuracy."

**Client:** "We see. We did not realize the full implications of our decision and may reconsider how many workers we lay off."

#### 4. Scripture

> **Proverbs 14:25** <br> A truthful witness saves lives, but one who breathes out lies is deceitful.

#### 5. First Principle
Truth is something that can alwasy help. Sometimes people and clients do not fully understand the technology they are asking for. Many times simply communicating how they can better understand something and advocating for truth can help people.

### Option 3: Express Ethical Concerns to Manager
#### 1. Pros

* Is honest and blameless
* Could result in a changed decision
* Could result in a changed assignement

#### 2. Cons

* Could be seen as not committed by manager
* Could lead to frustrations by manager
* Could be forced to do the work/projct anyway

#### 3. Script

**Me:** "Hello, as I was looking over this project, I read that it would lead to a mass lay off at the company. This is something that ceratinly makes me uncomfortable and will weigh on my conscious."

**Manager:** "I can certainly see what you are saying and understand how you feel. Unfortuantely it is not our job to police our clients and the way they do business but to simply provide what they need."

**Me:** "I understand. Is there any way I can be moved to a different project?"

**Manager:** "No. Unfortunately I need you on this project. Nobody else can do it."

#### 4. Scripture

> **1 Peter 2:15** <br> For this is the will of God, that by doing good you should put to silence the ignorance of foolish people.

> **Ephesians 4:18** <br> They are darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them, due to their hardness of heart.

#### 5. First Principle
Sometimes seeking to to good is all the spark that is needed to ignite change. However, it doesn't always work that way. Sometimes others will be close minded or not have the ability to change things. Seeking to do good to others is commendable but the world doesn't always hold the same values. 

## Excursus

The dilemma here is that the client is attempting to save money and become more profitable by finding ways to lay off mass amounts of current employees. 

This is an issue because as Christians, we seek to help others, to not do harm to others, and to not seek money over the well being of others. While doing this project may not be *me* doing all those things, my doing this project will directly help someone else accomplish all of those things. 

## My Choice

I would choose option 3. While I clearly do not want to do this work, I also have earnetly seeked not to and to express my discomfort. God knows my heart and my desire for truth. If He calls me to leave my job over the project then he will guide my steps to that end; if He knows I tried and will do more good staying at the job, despite the consequences of some of the projects, he will guide my steps to stay. However, I also do not understand the full picture. While I don't want to aid in eliminating so many jobs for the sake of profit, I can never fully know why things happen. Some of these people getting fire may be what God actually *wants*. Not beacuse He wants to see them suffer but befacuse His plan is better than anyone knows. It is the same reason for understaing the problem of evil. We do not always know why we go through bad things, but we do know that God is soverign and God is good. Always.
