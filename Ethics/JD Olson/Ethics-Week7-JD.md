## Scenario  
A junior engineer at your company, leveraging advanced Artificial Intelligence, has completed a critical software project well ahead of schedule. The AI has written almost the entire application, raising questions about the engineer's understanding of the project's intricacies. Despite this, the company's management, impressed by the speedy delivery, is planning to integrate this AI-generated software into major systems immediately. You are concerned but you are also friends with this junior developer. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

## Three Possible Responses  

### **Option 1: Make sure your friend understands how the AI has created the project and proceed with its implementation**  
#### Pros: 
-  Allows for efficient use of time now that the project is completed early
-  Having your friend make sure they understand the AI code could save a headache in the future

#### Cons:
-  Might place too much trust in how effective early AI solutions are
-  If the code ends up messing up the entire project, you would feel guilty for not saying anything

#### Script:
**Me:** Hey (Friend), I think it is really great that you were able to leverage AI to make this project go quicker but do you think we could sit down and truly understand what it is doing?

**Friend:** Thanks, yes I would certainly be down to go over it, wouldn't want to mess anything up haha.

**Me:** Ok sounds good, lets meet over lunch and take a look at things before moving forward.
 

#### Scripture Reference:  
-  Proverbs 12:24 (NIV):  "Diligent hands will rule, but laziness ends in forced labor"

#### First Principle: 
-  A little diligence just because you can might be the difference between smooth sailing or an absolute nightmare

### **Option 2: Go to managment about the situation and your reservations** 
#### Pros:
- Could show how reliable you are 
- Might end up saving the company from disaster
- Could also save your friends job 

#### Cons:
- Could show a lack of trust in your junior developer friend
- Might not even be an issue at all 
- Managment might have already made up their minds about it

#### Script: 
**Me:** Hey (Managers), I understand that the AI software saved us alot of time but we should consider its reliability and who prompted it before implementing it. 

**Manager:** Hmm, you make a fair point, I think we should fully vet the code to make sure there are no suprises when we implement it.  

**Me:** I think that would be wise, we wouldnt want anything horrible to happen because we didnt check first.

**Manager:** Alright, thank you for bringing your concerns to us it shows us you really care.  

#### **Scripture Reference:**  
-   Ephesians 5:15 (NIV): "Be very careful, then, how you liveâ€”not as unwise but as wise, making the most of every opportunity, because the days are evil."


#### **First Principle:**  
-  We should be careful about anything we do and make sure not to put others down

### **Option 3: Do nothing and see what happens**  
#### Pros: 
-  The project might end up being a total success
-  The time saved might lead to other important projects getting done quicker
-  You will keep your friend and not lose his trust whatever happens 

#### Cons: 
-  The project could be a total mess
-  You might be asked why you didnt say anything about what might go wrong

#### Script: 
**Me:** Hey (Managers), I am excited to see how this project will turn out.  

**Managers:** Yes, we think it will provide some helpful insights into how we can use AI in the future.  

**Me:** Wow that would be awesome.  


#### **Scripture Reference:**  
-  John 14:27 (NIV). "Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid."

#### **First Principle:**  
- We can trust the Lord to have His hands in anything we do

## **Excursus:**  
- This scenario is less ethical and more based on the outcome of the scenario
- The company would have the majority of the damage if all goes wrong, but your friend could lose his job too. 
- Not much personal risk in this one.

## **My Choice: Option 1 **  
- I would choose option 1 because if looking deeply at the code shows us something bad, then we can bring those concerns to management together.
Doing so would allow me and my friend to show our committment to diligence and effort and it would not reflect badly on us if there is an issue.
