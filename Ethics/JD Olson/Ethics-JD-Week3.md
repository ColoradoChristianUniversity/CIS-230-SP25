While maintaining an extremely popular Open-Source project, authorities contact you asking that you introduce back door code to allow them to gather the needed evidence to stop an online child trafficking scheme. What are three responses? What do you do? 

## Three Possible Responses  

### **Option 1: Make them prove collecting evidence is all they will do in the repository**  
#### Pros: 
-  Prevents any malicious uses of this backdoor
-  Allows you to avoid personal issues if they do use the backdoor for other purposes
-  Shows your responsibility to look out for everyone who uses the repository 

#### Cons:
-  May prevent authorities good intentions unecessarily
-  Reluctance to work with authorities may look suspicious and get you in trouble
-  Could be a waste of time

#### Script:
**Me:** I undestand that you need a backdoor however due to the sensitive nature of having so many people using the repository, i will need you to verify exactly what you will be doing with it and i need you to make me directly involved in the process.  

**Authorities:** Ok, we did not expect to have so much pushback, but it is urgent to get this backdoor in so that we can start evidence collection so very well, you can be involved 

**Me:** Great, thank you. I had to check for a reason and if i do not then bad things could potentially happen. 

**Authorities:** Understood.  

#### Scripture Reference:  
-  Ephesians 5:15-16 (NIV): "Be very careful, then, how you liveâ€”not as unwise but as wise, making the most of every opportunity, because the days are evil."

#### First Principle: 
-  Whether or not it will put you in an uncomfortable position, it is best to be careful and do the right thing

### **Option 2: Allow them to do it and give them full control of the repository** 
#### Pros:
- Shows intent on full cooperation and desire to help stop online child trafficking
- Lets you move on from a potentially stressful scenario
- May hopefully prevent child trafficking

#### Cons:
- Could pose a problem for the repository users if the gov has access to their data
- Removing yourself from the equation doesn't neccessarily mean it is the best thing to do

#### Script: 
**Me:** I think that it would be best for me to hand the repository completely over to you guys in order to do what you need. 

**Authorities:** Are you sure? We simply need a backdoor put in and you can still have control of everything else.  

**Me:** Ya i am sure, i think this whole situation would be best if you guys had full control.  

**Customer:** Ok, if your sure then yes we will go forward with that decision.  

#### **Scripture Reference:**  
-   Psalm 37:3 (NIV): "Trust in the Lord and do good;
dwell in the land and enjoy safe pasture."


#### **First Principle:**  
-  Trust can go a long way, if we trust the Lord will use a situation for good then that is a clear sign to move forward

### **Option 3: Fully cooperate and implement the back door**  
#### Pros: 
-  Allows the authorities to start collecting evidence
-  May have implications that change lives for good later on
-  Could lead to conviction of criminals

#### Cons: 
-  You may feel weird knowing people are being spied on by the authorities
-  You are going behind the backs of people who trust the repository

#### Script: 
**Me:** I will certainly put this back door in immediately.  

**Authorities:** Awesome! Your cooperation will hopefully save many kids.  

**Me:** Wow, thats amazing! happy to be of service.  
  

#### **Scripture Reference:**  
-  Matthew 5:9 (NIV): "Blessed are the peacemakers,
for they will be called children of God."

#### **First Principle:**  
- Whatever we can do to protect the children of God should be done without question.

## **Excursus:**  
- This example seems like an easy choice considering the lives of children are at stake and the moral decision would be to do whatever it takes to save them
- We are assuming for the most part that these authorities can be trusted
- While a back door is sneaky, if used for good then it as an acceptable decision

## **My Choice: Option 3 **  
- I think it would be best to go along with what the authorities want considering they are trying to do good
- I would not want to get in the way of or present a roadblock for authorities when it comes to child trafficking victims
