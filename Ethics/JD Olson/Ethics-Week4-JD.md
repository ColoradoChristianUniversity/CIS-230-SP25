## Scenario  
While working on a project under intense budget and time pressures, a key teammate shares with you in confidence that he is suffering from debilitating depression. If this project fails, your company will lose their largest customer. What are three responses? What do you do?

## Three Possible Responses  

### **Option 1: Check in on your Co-worker and make sure they are ok regardless of the project outcome**  
#### Pros: 
-  Shows that you care about the well-being of those you work with
-  Limits any unfortunate choice your co-worker may decide to make in response to the project
-  May inspire your co-worker to work hard to make the project work

#### Cons:
-  Could make the project fail if you are more focused on your co-workers health than the task at hand
-  Might make things worse if you draw too much attention to your co-worker

#### Script:
**Me:** Hey (Co-worker), I wanted to check in and see how you are doing with everything, I know that your feeling down and I want you to know I am here for you.  

**Co-worker:** I appreciate it, yes I have not been doing so good and I think if this project doesn't pan out things will not be good at all.

**Me:** Im so sorry to hear than, well I can help get you in contact with some professional help and then we can go from there, also I can take on some of your work if that would make things a little easier in this difficult season. 

**Co-worker:** Ok, thank you.  

#### Scripture Reference:  
-  Mark 12:30-31 (NIV):  "Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.' 31 The second is this: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ There is no commandment greater than these.”

#### First Principle: 
-  Sometimes the best thing we can do in a situation is love those around us endlessly

### **Option 2: Focus on making the project a success and encourage your co-worker to do the same** 
#### Pros:
- Could create a situation where you keep the client due to your hard work
- Shows your committment to the company that you desire to make things work out

#### Cons:
- In the pursuit of keeping the client your co-worker might fall further into depression
- May be a waste of time if your efforts do not produce the desired outcome
- If the client is lost then it could cause your co-worker to go over the edge

#### Script: 
**Me:** I am going to work as hard as possible to make sure the relationship with our customer is secure. 

**Boss:** I am glad to hear it, we really need this to work out, also maybe check in on (co-worker) to make sure everything is ok.  

**Me:** Ok I could do that, not sure it is too necessary at this moment since there are more critical decisions to be made.

**Boss:** Sure i get that, thank you for your willingness to work so hard.  

#### **Scripture Reference:**  
-   Collosians 3:23 (NIV): "Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters"


#### **First Principle:**  
-  We should work as hard as we can for anything we do, because we do it for the Lord

### **Option 3: Both check in on your co-worker and work hard at keeping the customer**  
#### Pros: 
-  Will hopefully make things pan out for the business to keep the relationship
-  Can create a good outcome for your co-worker 
-  May be a win-win scenario for both the business and your co-worker

#### Cons: 
-  Typically you cannot always make everything work perfectly everytime so this choice has some potential issues

#### Script: 
**Me:** Hey (co-worker), just wanted to check in and get you connected with some mental health professionals so that you can beat this depression, I am also going to work hard to make this deal work out between us and the customer.  

**Co-worker:** Wow thank you, that is so nice of you, and yes i am sure this will work out.  

**Me:** Great, so glad i can help in any way, let me know if you need anything else while i am working.  


#### **Scripture Reference:**  
-  1 Timothy 4:15-16 (NIV). "Be diligent in these matters; give yourself wholly to them, so that everyone may see your progress. Watch your life and doctrine closely. Persevere in them, because if you do, you will save both yourself and your hearers."

#### **First Principle:**  
- We can be diligent in all we do and even though sometimes we cannot do everything

## **Excursus:**  
- This scenario could either end really well, or very poorly depending on your solution
- This probably happens quite often and is simply part of interacting with other humans in the workplace
- With the proper measures, this outcome could be positive

---

## **My Choice: Option 3 **  
- I think combining a bit of option 1 and 2 into option 3 would be the best choice because it covers all the ethical issues
- I would make sure the co-worker is ok and then focus heavily on supporting the project since the two choices are not mutually exclusive.
