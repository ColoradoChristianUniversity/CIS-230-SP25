## Scenario  
This week is different

ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è The root of this site has the ethics write-up of everyone in class. You can go there, and you can browse and read anyone's essays. Looking back on the first 5 week's prompts, choose the one that resonated with you most. Pick two other students in class and read their options and their choices. In this week's essay, summarize each of those responses with a simple bullet list in your own file and then pretend THEIR CHOICES are the only choices you have (don't go back and revisit your essay for the prompt). Given their choices only, which would YOU choose? Do you agree with the authors? Explain why or why not.

## Answers pulled from the Week 3 scenario  

### Gabe  
*  **Reject the proposal from the authorities**
    - Indicates the belief that you have that kind of bargaining power over the authorities
    - Allows you take the ethical high road for the sake of the users regardless of who is asking at the expense of helping victims
*  **Implement the backdoor but make sure every detail is made transparent**
    - enables the full amount of trust between the server and the users
    - Shows the desire to cooperate with the authorities under the right conditions and helo the trafficking victims
*  **Fully cooperate and implement the backdoor without question**
    - Shows dedication to your work and respect for authority

### Brady  
*  **Help the authorities fully implement the backdoor for the greater good**
    - Places more importance on helping the trafficking victims than preserving the integrity of the server
*  **Focus on the integrity of the server and deny the authorities request**
    - Builds trust with the users
    - Could potentially make the trafficking situation worse
*  **Cooperate with the authorities under the condition that accessibility is only given to them and that they do not spy on users unless to help trafficking victims**
    - Offers a proper compromise that is not outside the realm of reason

## Reflection

With both responses there are many solid choices to choose from that would make ethical sense. The hard part about this scenario is that there are two obligations, one to help out the trafficking victims, and the other to protect the privacy of the server users. Both Brady and Gabe have similar answers to how to deal with the scenario.

### My Choice
I would go with Brady's third option to Cooperate with the authorities but only under a few conditions. I like this choice because it offers both the appropriate cooperation to help the trafficking victims and preservation of the users privacy. It spells out exactly how the authorities should use the backdoor and sets up checks and balances so they do not overstep their bounds for any reason. I agree with this decision because if I was the one making it I wouldn't feel guilt toward any side afterward since both sides are taken care of.
