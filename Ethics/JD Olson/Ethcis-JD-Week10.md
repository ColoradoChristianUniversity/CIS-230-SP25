## Scenario  
While working on an engineering team, you mentor a teammate for 6 months to no avail, he is just not catching on. You learn he up for a raise as company leadership has mistakenly given him sole credit for work you have done together. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

## Three Possible Responses  

### **Option 1: Report it and make sure your boss knows who the credit should go to with supporting evidence**  
#### Pros: 
-  Gives credit where credit is due
-  You will benefit from the raise 
-  Helps the company avoid any further issues of credit taking

#### Cons:
-  Could lose a positive relationship with your teammate
-  If your superiors do not believe you then it will look bad and not professional 

#### Script:
**Me:** Hey (Boss), I understand that (Teammate) is up for a raise due to the recent work on our project, however I think it should be known that I was the largest contributor to it.

**Boss:** Oh, well (Teammate) has been telling us that they were actually the largest part of the project's success.

**Me:** Well, the truth of it is that I was mentoring (Teammate) and they were doing tasks I put them up to and explained how to do. It seems that there might be some dishonesty going on.

**Boss:** Ok well thank you for letting me know and we will look into it. If what you say is true then the raise actually belongs to you.
 

#### Scripture Reference:  
-  Proverbs 12:19 (NIV): “Truthful lips endure forever, but a lying tongue lasts only a moment.”

#### First Principle: 
-  It is ok to stand against someone else's dishonesty if it means your name is on the line

### **Option 2: Go to your teammate about it and ask why they would take credit and tell them to explain the situation to your boss** 
#### Pros:
- Promotes a high standard for those you mentor 
- Allows the right thing to be done without going behind your teammates back
- It is a good lesson for your teammate to learn 

#### Cons:
- Your teammate might be even more dishonest about the situation
- Things could get hostile between you  
- They may not listen to you and not take action to do the right thing

#### Script: 
**Me:** Hey (Teammate), I have heard that you are up for a raise even though you know full well I was the biggest contributor to the project. 

**Teammate:** Well sure but your not the one up for the raise are you.

**Me:** No but they certainly made a mistake and I think you should go to them and explain what really happened.

**Teammate:** As much as I don't want to I respect you and your time to mentor me so sure I will do that.  

#### **Scripture Reference:**  
-   Exodus 20:16 (NIV): "You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor." 


#### **First Principle:**  
-  People need to step up and do the right thing regardless of how they feel about it

### **Option 3: Do nothing and let it play out**  
#### Pros: 
-  You won't cause any drama
-  The truth may come out naturally

#### Cons: 
-  You are not standing up for yourself
-  This might make your career progression even longer than you thought

#### Script: 
**Me:** Hey (Teammate), just wanted to say great job on the project.  

**Teammate:** Thank you! They are giving me a raise for it for some reason. I'll take it though haha.  

**Me:** Ya I wonder why ... well goodluck on the next one.  


#### **Scripture Reference:**  
-  Romans 15:13 (NIV): "May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit".

#### **First Principle:**  
- Sometimes the only thing we can do is be at peace with a situation

## **Excursus:**  
- This scenario is very interesting because there is a clear right and wrong
- The outcome is entirely dependent on how you choose to deal with it
- Hopefully this does not happen often, but sadly it probably does

## **My Choice: Option 1 **  
- I would choose option 2 first and confront my teammate about it and then if they do not decide to do anything about it I would take it a step higher and go directly to the boss because there is a clear answer to who deserves the raise and who is trying to make it seem like they deserve it.
