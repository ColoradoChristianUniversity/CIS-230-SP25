## Scenario  
While writing some code Saturday night, you realize you have introduced a crippling bug that breaks the entire system. As a Christian, you have politely requested no deadlines, meetings or work ever occur on Sunday. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

## Three Possible Responses  

### **Option 1: Do nothing about it and wait to handle it during the week**  

| Pros | Cons | 
| :---------------:| :---------------: |
| Lets you keep the Sabbath | Might be stressed out all of Sunday | 
| Makes the company respect your wish to not work on Sunday | Will look bad and unreliable | 
| | Shows lack of integrity and responsibility | 


#### Script (That Monday):
**Boss:** Did you seriously know about this on Saturday and decide not to do anything about it?

**Me:** Yes, I have asked to not have anything assigned or due on Sunday and I intended to stand by that.

**Boss:** I understand but telling nobody about it has now crippled the entire system.
 

#### Scripture Reference:  
-  Exodus 20:8 (NIV):  "Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy"

#### First Principle: 
-   It is reasonable to stand up for principles you believe in.

### **Option 2: Inform your leadership of the bug and intentions to fix it on Sunday** 
| Pros | Cons | 
| :---------------:| :---------------: |
| Shows integrity and desire to take responsibility  | Goes against your own wishes | 
| Could save the system from catastrophy  | The company may not consider your desire to not work on Sunday anymore | 
|Sets a precedent of trust and transparency| Will spend your weekend fixing a bug | 

#### Script (On Saturday): 
**Me:** Hey (Boss), I think it would be wise for me to let you know I think I accidentally implemented a bug into the system. 

**Boss:** Oh no, we need to get on this as soon as possible.  

**Me:** I am already on it, I will take the rest of the weekend to fix my mistake and hopefully not make it again.

**Boss:** Thank you for caring about this and for taking your weekend to fix it. This is an impressive show of good character.  

#### **Scripture Reference:**  
-   Proverbs 28:13 (NIV): "Whoever conceals their sins does not prosper, but the one who confesses and renounces them finds mercy."


#### **First Principle:**  
-  It is often best to come forward and face an issue head on rather than keep it quiet.

### **Option 3: Bring the bug to attention but do not claim it was your doing**  
| Pros | Cons | 
| :---------------:| :---------------: |
| Eliminates any issues the bug will cause  | Might be unethical to not claim responsibility | 
| Might not mean you have to deal with it  | Will be in trouble if anyone finds out it is your fault | 
|Will look like you have a good attention to detail| Company might force you to work on it anyway | 

#### Script (On Saturday): 
**Me:** Hey (Boss), I found a bug in the system that should probably be dealt with.  

**Boss:** Wow, great attention to detail! We will get someone else to deal with it this weekend.  

**Me:** Great thanks! Glad I could help.  


#### **Scripture Reference:**  
-  Matthew 6:22-23 (NIV). "The eye is the lamp of the body. If your eyes are healthy, your whole body will be full of light. But if your eyes are unhealthy, your whole body will be full of darkness"

#### **First Principle:**  
- Having a sharp eye can be handy in many situations

## **Excursus:**  
- This scenario does not necessarily have any ideal outcomes because they either require you to work on Sunday or not take responsibility
- There must be many situations like this all the time at various companies. 
- If it is bad enough, dealing with this scenario poorly could probably lead to you losing your job.

---

## **My Choice: Option 2 **  
- I would choose option 2 because it seems that the best way forward would be to take responsibility and try to rectify the situation. This would also let me feel less bad about someone else having to fix my problem. From then on I would continue to try and not work on Sunday but this scenario is so specific that it will be ok this one time.
