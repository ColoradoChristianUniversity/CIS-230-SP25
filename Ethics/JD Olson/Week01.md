<h1>Question
<h3>
While working as an engineer at a Credit Card company, you are tasked to resolve problems experienced by your employerâ€™s second largest customer: a well-known pornography web site. Resolving their problems will not only reduce their frustration but should make them considerably more efficient and profitable. What are three possible responses? 
What do you do?
<h1> Answer

<h2>Option 1: Stay client focused and proceed

<h2>Pros:

- Displays loyalty and professionalism to the company

- Shows ability to remove personal bias from the equation

- May lead to increased business and profitability

<h2> Cons:

- Can go against personal beliefs and moral ideals

- May lead to some undesirable, awkward, or uncomfortable experiences dealing with such a company

Script:

- Me: Hey I think i have some ideas to fix some of these issues our client is facing
- Supervisor: Great, go ahead and implement those changes as soon as possible
- Me: Will do! glad we can serve all our clients effectivly

Scripture: 

Matthew 23:11 (NIV) - "The greatest among you will be your servant"

First Principle:

Sometimes in order to avoid conflict and strife the best thing to do is to put our heads down and serve others.

<h2>Option 2: Request to be moved to different project

<h2>Pros:

- Allows me to respectfully offer help elsewhere

- Allows morals and standards to be upheld

- Keeps professionalism and reduces the need to make a scene

<h2> Cons:

- May set a bad opinion of your ability to fulfill assigned responsibilities

- Has the potential to escalate and turn into a sour situation if not dealt with correctly or graciously

Script:

- Me: Hi (Supervisor Name), I noticed the project i was just assigned to and was wondering about the possibility of being reassigned to a different project. I feel as if my skills would be better used elsewhere as i am not necessarily comfortable working on this project.
- Supervisor: Ok i understand, while it would be nice to have more people on board for this project i appreciate you coming to me and we can totally get you reassigned.
- Me: Ok thank you I am looking forward to this new project.

Scripture: 

Romans 14:22 (NIV) - "So whatever you believe about these things keep between yourself and God. Blessed is the one who does not condemn himself by what he approves."

First Principle:

There can certainly be a balance between keeping ones dignity and integrity while still being respectful and willing to do work.

<h2>Option 3: Bring your reservations and questions to the higher management

<h2>Pros:

- Instantly makes the immediate reservations known to leadership

- Can potentially save the company a painful issue

- Might be exaclty what others are wanting to do but are too nervous to actually do

<h2> Cons:

- May be percieved as a wish to remove workload or responsibility 

- May lead to questions on the validity of such questions if everyone else is fine with the work

- At an extreme could lead to job loss if leadership doesnt want people asking questions about who to work with

Script:

- Me: Thank you for meeting with me today, i wanted to address some issues going through with serving this client may present. 
- Management: And those are??
- Me: Well, it seems that many of us who would be working in this are uncomfortable with this client and do not think our time and attention should be spent on such divisive cleintel.
-   Management: That is noted however these clients will significantly help our bottom line and if do not wish to work with them then you are not going to work here any longer.

Scripture: 

Proverbs 16:12: - "Good leaders abhor wrongdoing and have a moral foundation."

First Principle:

Even though it can be scary, pushing important decisions up the chain can often be a good idea, regardless the outcome.
