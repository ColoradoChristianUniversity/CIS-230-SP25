## Scenario  
You are a software engineer working for a marketing firm that has been hired by a tobacco company to analyze data for a new product. Your team is excited to work on this project because it could save your struggling company during a bad economy. However, you suspect the customer is intending the product for young audiences, but you are not sure. To make matters worse, you have been trying to build a relationship with a coworker who has criticized religion as judgmental; you are worried that taking a moral stand against this product could come across as hypocritical and cause you to lose the opportunity to reach him just as he is softening to spiritual conversations. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

## Three Possible Responses  

### **Option 1: Take the moral stand against the product and deal with the coworker later**  
#### Pros: 
-  Might save many young people from suffering from tabacco or vape addiction
-  Might potentially save your company from a lawsuit 
-  Addressing the potential issues now might prevent a massive problem later

#### Cons:
-  You probably will come across as hypocritical to your coworker
-  Your company might not like you raising an issue with the one project that will save them during the tough times

#### Script:
**Me:** Hey (Boss), I know that this project is very important for the company but I have some reservations about working with (Client)

**Boss:** Well it is very critical that we have something to work on in this season to stay afloat. Tell me your reservations though.

**Me:** I think that they plan on targeting young audiences as their primary consumer, which is exactly how Juul found themselves amidst a swarm of lawsuits and overall led to a significant decline in profitability. I think we should find a different Client to work with.

**Boss:** Ok, these concerns are valid but sadly the company cannot risk letting go of a secured source of revenue right now. If times were not so tight we might be able to think about the ethics of the project. 
 

#### Scripture Reference:  
-  Colossians 3:13 (NIV): “Bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone. Forgive as the Lord forgave you.”

#### First Principle: 
-  We should raise concerns, but also forgive one another because we may not always understand the full scope of an issue

### **Option 2: Do not raise any concerns about the project and keep working on being a good witness to your coworker** 
#### Pros:
- May lead to your coworker giving their life to Christ
- Shows you are dedicated to your work
- may prove more fruitful than raising concerns about the project

#### Cons:
- Might lead to some major problems down the road because you said nothing
- Your coworker may not be totally open to it 

#### Script: 
**Me:** Hey (Coworker), I was wondering if you maybe wanted to grab lunch and I can talk to you a bit more about what I believe as a Christian. No pressure at all just thought I'd ask. 

**Coworker:** Ya that sounds good to me, it'll be nice to take a break from this project.

**Me:** For sure, i'll meet you in the lobby at say 12:30?

**Coworker:** Ok!


#### **Scripture Reference:**  
-   Romans 10:14 (NIV): "How, then, can they call on the one they have not believed in? And how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without someone preaching to them?" 


#### **First Principle:**  
-  If someone is open to it, we should not hesistate to tell them about the gospel.

### **Option 3: Do both if you can, raise the concerns and keep talking to your coworker about Christianity**  
#### Pros: 
-  Might be the best of both world's
-  If it works, then you will have taken the most ethical route possible

#### Cons: 
-  You are risking losing your coworker being open to hearing more about the gospel
-  You could lose both battles and end up worse off than just choosing one route

#### Script: 
**Me:** Hey (Boss), I think that working with (Client) might not be a good idea because they are going to target youth as their ideal market demographic.  

**Coworker:** Wow, thats a little judgmental coming from the guy claiming to be a morally sound person.  

**Me:** It actually has nothing to do with that. I don't think parents will want a company to prey on their children to get them addicted to a substance that could ruin their life.  

**Coworker:** Ya actually that is a fair point, sorry for what I said.  

**Boss:** Ya I think that would be pretty bad to endorse that kind of behavior especially as a marketing firm, we will figure something else out.


#### **Scripture Reference:**  
-  Romans 12:18 (NIV): "If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone.".

#### **First Principle:**  
- We should strive to find the best solution in any situation

## **Excursus:**  
- This scenario could either go very well or very poorly
- There is no good outcome if you do nothing about both situations

---

## **My Choice: Option 3 **  
- I would choose option 3 because it is a higher risk, higher reward choice. I think that acting boldly in this scenario will eliminate any guilt than if I just chose one of the options.
