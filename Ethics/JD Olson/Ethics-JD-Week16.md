## Scenario  
You're a software engineer in America. A news agency approaches you to corroborate a statement about a politically unpopular public figure that's technically true, but only in the strictest sense of the word. You suspect their agenda is to publicly cancel this person. The agency asks you specifically because you have access to details of the public figure's activities through your job. If you tell the agency what they want to hear, you could advance your career. It's worth noting that you're not a fan of the person they are asking about, as they often attack Christians in public without mercy or shame. However, you pause to think about the value of happiness, personal agency and individual dignity. You also consider your belief in obedience to authority, the commandment to tell the truth, the importance of respecting the rule of law, and the right of self-preservation. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

## Three Possible Responses  

### **Option 1: Decline to give the news agency any information on the public figure**  
#### Pros: 
-  Preserves the privacy of the individual 
-  You will not feel guilty if they are canceled
-  Might prevent an even worse scenario like a defamation lawsuit that gets put back on you

#### Cons:
-  The news agency might say they got certain information from you anyway
-  You might never get as far in your career than if you had helped them

#### Script:
**News Agency:** Hey (Me), We would like to have the information on (the person) so we can write an article about it. We know for a fact this article will be on front pages everywhere we just need the final piece of evidence from you.

**Me:** Ok, while I do have access to the information I am not going to provide it as it will break privacy laws and potentially harm the individual.

**News Agency:** Sure but do you know what they have done? It is crazy if you look into it and we can certainly help your career

**Me:** That's great but you must understand I am still not giving you anything. Have a good day.
 

#### Scripture Reference:  
-  Proverbs 11:3 (NIV): “The integrity of the upright guides them, but the unfaithful are destroyed by their duplicity..”

#### First Principle: 
- We need to stand on our principles and have integrity in everything we do.

### **Option 2: Give the news agency the information on the person ** 
#### Pros:
- Might prevent further public slander of Christianity 
- Your career will probably benefit 
- Might take the person out of the limelight

#### Cons:
- Could compromise your moral beliefs 
- The news agency might go further than you would think to slander this person 
- Your career might not actually benefit as they use that as leverage to get the information from you

#### Script: 
**Me:** Hey (news agency), I have that information you need for (the person). 

**News Agency:** Great! thank you, we will for sure be using this.

**Me:** What are you going to do with it again.

**Teammate:** Don't worry about it, we are just putting out an article about (the person).  

#### **Scripture Reference:**  
-   Philippians 2:4 (NIV): "not looking to your own interests but each of you to the interests of the others." 


#### **First Principle:**  
-  We should help others if we can

### **Option 3: Provide the news agency with false information that will be useless**  
#### Pros: 
-  They won't know you gave them wrong information
-  They will hopefully go away

#### Cons: 
-  The news story might come out regardless 
-  If they find out then your career might be in trouble

#### Script: 
**Me:** Hey (news agency), I have the information you requested about (the person).  

**News Agency:** Sweet, we will take a look and get back to you.  

**Me:** Ok great, just let me know.  


#### **Scripture Reference:**  
-  Proverbs 31:9 (NIV): "Speak up and judge fairly;
    defend the rights of the poor and needy."

#### **First Principle:**  
- We should seek the truth and not forget we are all fallen

## **Excursus:**  
- This scenario probably occurs quite frequently
- It is certainly difficult to choose what to do because the options all seem bad

---

## **My Choice: Option 1 **  
- I would choose to not give the news agency anything about the person because they can probably get that information from someone else. I would feel weird seeing a news article that ruins someones life knowing I contributed to the whole thing in a big way.
