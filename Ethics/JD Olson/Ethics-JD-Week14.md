
## Scenario  
You are part of a development team for a software company creating a machine learning tool that can identify subtle items in large data sets. The government agency funding this tool plans to use it to identify religious references in public places that have gone unnoticed for years until put under the scrutiny of your tool. They hope to stall religious conflict by removing whatever your tool identifies through strict regulation to better secularize public places. You are excited about the success of a tool you have worked hard to perfect for years. The product manager speculates it could potentially be licensed to foreign governments in the future wanting to accomplish similar goals. However, you also have misgivings. What are three possible responses? What do you do?

## Three Possible Responses  

### **Option 1: Go to the product manager to see if anything can be done to limit licensing to foreign governments**  
#### Pros: 
-  Could potentially save persecuted Christians in opressive foreign countries from being discovered
-  Shows your desire to think critically about potential pitfalls to certain decisions
-  Prevents copycat behavior and the stealing of good ideas by other countries

#### Cons:
-  There may be nothing you can do about it since funding comes from a government agency and thus the decisions come from them
-  The scope of your concern may not be fully understood by those looking to accomplish one specific goal

#### Script:
**Me:** Hey (Product Manager), I understand that our tool is coming along nicely but I have some concerns about the long-term use of such a tool

**Product Manager:** Oh ok, what are you thinking?

**Me:** Well, I am sure that domestic use will be safe and probably beneficial in some capacity, however I am concerned about what happens if we give the tool to other governments around the globe, and the safety issues it might present inside a country with limited freedoms. 

**Boss:** I understand your concerns, I will make sure to look into more safety procedures for our product.
 
#### Scripture Reference:  
-  Phillipians 2:3-4 (NIV): "Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility value others above yourselves, not looking to your own interests but each of you to the interests of the others."

#### First Principle: 
-  It is often important to think not about ourselves all the time but also about others and how certain actions will affect them.

### **Option 2: Pursue the creation of the best product possible and forget about your concerns** 
#### Pros:
- Shows devotion to your job and intention on doing good work 
- Displays the value you offer the company on completing projects well
- The use of the tool is up to the government and not your concern

#### Cons:
- May not be an ethically sound decision
- Could lead to some global mishap that you will feel forever guilty for

#### Script: 
**Me:** Hey (Project Manager), I think our amazing product is almost done, it has been a pleasure to work on this and incredibly rewarding to see it work as intended.

**Project Manager:** Great work, I am impressed with your dedication to this.

**Me:** Thank you, I love working on projects like these and hope to have more in the future
 

#### **Scripture Reference:**  
-   Proverbs 10:4 (NIV): "A slack hand causes poverty, but the hand of the diligent makes rich."  


#### **First Principle:**  
-  Being diligent and doing the job set before you can often be very rewarding

### **Option 3: Implement a hidden feature that will confuse religious references with normal secular references if used for a certain amount of time**  
#### Pros: 
-  Might prolong the protection of religion in public places and in countries
-  Low chance of being discovered if created properly and hidden well

#### Cons: 
-  Not what the project calls for you to do
-  May put your job at risk if you are discovered

#### Script: 
**Me:** Hey (Product Manager), I added some more backend code to help speed up our tool (half-truth)

**Product Manager:** Great work! This will be our best tool yet.  

**Me:** For sure, I am proud of our work on this product.


#### **Scripture Reference:**  
-  Galatians 6:9 (NIV): "Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up."

#### **First Principle:**  
- It is often a good idea to take the option that will reap the most good in a situation

## **Excursus:**  
- This scenario has many implications for others and yourself
- There is no guarantee that the tool will be used for evil, but we live in a fallen world and you never know

## **My Choice: Option 1 **  
- I would choose option 1 and present my concerns to the product manager in order to raise awareness to the possibility of misuse of the product. Hopefully, sending these concerns up the chain will result in a safeguard being implemented into the product so that it will not be used to harm people or groups.
